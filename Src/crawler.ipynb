      "The Speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, has demanded “an end to hatred” against MPs and a kinder form of political discourse following the fatal stabbing of Sir David Amess, as evidence mounts of the shocking scale of intimidation and threats suffered daily by elected politicians and their staff. In a highly unusual intervention for a Commons Speaker, Hoyle makes the appeal as he writes in the Observer. He describes the late Tory MP and father of five as a friend who would regularly drop into his office for a chat, and as “a man who found a connection with everyone, no matter their background”. On Saturday, political leaders put on a defiant show of unity and solidarity, with Boris Johnson and Sir Keir Starmer, along with Hoyle and the home secretary, Priti Patel, together laying wreaths at Belfairs Methodist church in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, where Amess died after being stabbed repeatedly as he held his constituency surgery on Friday. A man was arrested shortly after the attack and remains in police custody. The suspect, named by police sources as Ali Harbi Ali, 25, is said to be a British national of Somali heritage, who is believed to have been referred to the Prevent programme but is not on MI5’s database of persons of interest. Detectives were on Saturday granted a warrant to hold him until 22 October. Hoyle, who reveals how he decided to hold his own two-hour surgery just four hours after learning of Amess’s killing, says that while the security offered to MPs must now be reviewed, there is a wider problem about the levels of hatred and intimidation in politics that must be addressed. “If anything positive is to come out of this latest awful tragedy,” he says, “it is that the quality of political discourse has to change. The conversation has to be kinder and based on respect.” With many MPs privately confiding that they face death threats on a regular basis on social media, Hoyle adds: “The hate which drives these attacks has to end. Disagreements with politicians should be solved at the ballot box not via threats, intimidation or murder.” The Observer understands that the House of Commons Commission, chaired by Hoyle, which deals with security matters relating to MPs, has been informed of hundreds of reports of serious abuse and threats against members – including death threats – over recent months. One senior Westminster source said the numbers of people now in prison or awaiting trial for threatening MPs or abusing them was “staggering”. “It is a British disease,” the source said. “The numbers are horrifying. It is an epidemic.” Shailesh Vara, the Tory MP for North-West Cambridgeshire and a former minister, said the kind of language used by people when communicating with MPs, either on social media or by other means, was becoming more hostile and aggressive all the time and was affecting MPs’ staff as well as elected representatives. “To call me the C-word or to refer to politicians like me as bastards and to use unpleasant and aggressive tones is normal for some people these days. What they don’t realise is that it is not just us they are abusing. It is our staff, people who are just trying to do a job, trying to earn enough to put food on the table, pay their mortgage and the bills. “With the volume of correspondence we get now, we need to have staff. Not so long ago, MPs would get about 20 letters a week, they shared one secretary between them all and an MP could write 20 handwritten letters to those constituents and all was well and good. Now I can get more than 25 emails in less than an hour.” Jade Botterill, a former assistant to Labour MP Yvette Cooper, said she had left politics because of the abuse directed at her boss, who is a former Cabinet minister. “I would get in and all I would do is go on Facebook and report death threats and delete them,” said Botterill, who worked for Cooper from 2013 to 2019. “I reckon I reported over 1,000 death threats. I couldn’t sleep,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “I would have these nightmares that I would be in the office with Yvette and someone would come up to her and kill her.” The senior Tory MP Charles Walker, who is a member of the Commons Commission, which will meet on Monday to discuss the implications of Amess’s killing, said: “Living in fear has become a routine part of many of my colleagues’ lives. Many have the incredible ability to compartmentalise that part of their existences but it should not have to be that way.” Some MPs complained they had given up passing on issues to police because threats were often not taken seriously unless someone had been physically threatened. Harriet Harman, the former Labour deputy leader, is pressing for a cross-party summit with the security services to discuss how to improve security. Some MPs spoke privately of wanting to move or end walk-in constituency surgeries as a result of the risks they and their staff were facing. In 2015-16, the amount spent on MPs’ security was just £171,000. By 2017-18, that had expanded to £4.2m. On Monday, Commons time will be set aside for tributes to Amess and the former Home Office minister James Brokenshire, who died this month from cancer. On Saturday there was a mixed response from MPs as to how they would handle surgeries with constituents. While several were defiant and tweeted about conducting them as normal, others said the age in which MPs pre-announced the time and place of their surgeries, which were then open to all comers, had to end. Former minister Tobias Ellwood called for a pause to in-person meetings until a security review ordered by Patel on Friday had been completed. Ellwood, who chairs the Commons defence committee, tweeted: “MP engagement with the public … is a vital part of our work – our accessibility with the public. But understandable huge anxiety among MPs now. Until the home secretary’s review of MP security is complete I would recommend a temporary pause in face-to-face meetings.” But former Cabinet minister David Davis disagreed: “Sure, we should be cautious, maybe we should do things to ensure the people who come to see us are bona fide, but I think actually pausing it would be a bad idea. It would be a terrible reflection of what David stood for – David himself was the ultimate constituency MP.” Labour party sources last night said that the party would not stand a candidate in a Southend West by-election to replace Amess.\n",

      "Shortly after 9am on Saturday , Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer bent to lay wreaths and, united briefly by grief, turned grimly from the Essex church where Conservative MP Sir David Amess had been killed less than 24 hours earlier. Accompanied by the rumble of helicopters, the political leaders soon left Leigh-on-Sea and a community searching for answers. What made someone kill one of Westminster’s most admired MPs in a town judged one of the country’s best places to live? The man arrested on suspicion of killing the MP is Ali Harbi Ali, a 25-year-old British born man whose family fled to the UK from war ravaged Somalia. He was arrested at the scene on suspicion of murder but was further detained detained under section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000. Counter-terrorism detectives from the Met’s SO15 unit, investigating the killing,moved him yesterday from Essex to a London police station. A warrant of further detention, allowing detectives to hold him until October 22, was granted at Westminster Magistrates’ Court yesterday. Prior to the terror charge, officers from the Metropolitan Police’s counter-terrorism unit said they were investigating “a potential motivation linked to Islamist extremism”. According to multiple sources the man is said not to be on MI5’s vast, evolving database of people of interest. However, he is believed to have been referred to the Prevent programme, the official programme to stop radicalisation. It is reported that his involvement was short. He has no known previous terrorist involvement. Police have said they are not looking for anyone else. Police also raided three addresses in London yesterday, one in Croydon in south London and two others in Kentish Town and Bounds Green in north London. Ali is said to have lived or have family links in the Southend area but had moved to London. On Friday he travelled to Essex by train but told Tory constituency workers he had recently moved to the area and wanted to speak to the MP. Whatever emerges from the investigation, the events soon after noon on Friday have traumatised the people of Leigh-on-Sea and far beyond. Previous Islamist terrorist attacks have prompted a rise in hate crimes, and the police declaration of a terrorist incident has already turned attention to Leigh’s modest Muslim population, which, according to the last census, stood at 1.9% for Southend-on-Sea, which incorporates Leigh and Belfairs, the district where Amess was stabbed to death at a constituency surgery. The Zaidis are one of the area’s most prominent Muslim families and were close friends with Amess. The death of Habib Zaidi, 76, who ran a Belfairs GP surgery before succumbing to Covid-19 last year, was mentioned by Amess in parliament. Their relationship, said Zaidi’s wife, articulated what she believed was the effortless multiculturalism of Leigh-on-Sea. Speaking 100 metres from where Amess was killed, she said: “It’s extremely integrated around here. There’s no race hate, everyone coexists here in peace.” Her son shook his head when asked if the MP’s death could destabilise the area. Further along Eastwood Road North, student Grisharni Raviraj also described a town where, she said, she had experienced no racial disharmony. However, she admitted that already her parents had discussed security concerns in the wake of the tragedy, despite the family not being Muslim. “My parents have warned me, saying the first thing people notice is the colour of my skin,” said Raviraj, who has lived in the area for a decade. Across the road, Obinna said she was convinced that the perpetrator was not local. “This act must have been imported. There is no way this person can be from around here,” she said, gesturing towards the police tape keeping the public from the scene of Amess’s death. Obinna, who has lived in the area for more than 20 years, said she lived around the corner from the Belfairs Methodist Church where the stabbing took place. “Last night, even after what happened, I left my back door open all night,” she added . Meanwhile, a joint statement from all of Southend’s mosques described the fatal stabbing as an “indefensible atrocity”. Published on the Essex Jamme Masjid website, it said: “We look forward to the perpetrator being brought to justice.” Local resident Bhawani Bhardwaj, 74, echoed such sentiments. Stressing that the local south Asian community was “peace-loving”, he said: “If you read the Qu’ran, it says clearly that there shouldn’t be any violence.” He added: “This is the first time something like this has happened in Southend and we’re all really disturbed.” Southend councillor John Lamb, another close friend of Amess, said the attacker was waiting to see the MP then “drew a knife and stabbed him” when he was summoned. Butcher Lee Jordo, who works in the bustling parade of shops 100 metres from the scene, described hearing a commotion on Friday afternoon. He rushed over, arriving 15 minutes after the attack began, and saw a woman screaming on the phone: “Get here quick, he’s not breathing.” Unsurprisingly, he said the town was awash with rumour about how the attack progressed and the killer’s motives. “People have said the guy who did it didn’t make any attempt to run off. [Amess] was stabbed 17 times and then the guy just sat there,” said Jordo. “It could have been a lot worse,” he said. “I dread to think what would have happened if he’d have gone on a rampage.” He too, is among those who hope that the quest for answers doesn’t motivate some to target the town’s small south Asian population. “We can’t allow this to scare and divide people.” Others wondered how Amess’s two female members of staff – alongside him during the attack – were coping. Jane Riddle, who has lived in Belfairs for more than 50 years, said a neighbour was one of the assistants. “She’s worked for David for years. I think she’s got a good support network and she’s a governor at a local school, but it must be awful,” she said. As the police investigation continued into the night and the pile of flowers outside the church steadily grew, crowds congregated to pay tribute to their former MP. James Duddridge, MP for the neighbouring constituency, addressed the gathering with a microphone, describing how he had been inundated with tributes to Amess and reassured local people that “there is no ongoing threat to Southend”. Later, Stephen Aylen, a former independent councillor for the area, said that the death of “the perfect local MP” had prompted him to reanalyse some of the behaviour he had experienced as a politician. “I’m a nothing but I’ve been pushed up against the wall and punched. I’ve had human shit thrown at me … people are nasty but to pull out a knife is so exceptional,” he said. Yet most of those interviewed by the Observer portrayed Leigh-on-Sea as a place where extreme violence was rare. No longer. From here onwards, their town will be synonymous with the killing of its much-loved MP.\n",

[Amess] was stabbed 17 times and then the guy just sat there,” said Jordo. “It could have been a lot worse,” he said. “I dread to think what would have happened if he’d have gone on a rampage.” He too, is among those who hope that the quest for answers doesn’t motivate some to target the town’s small south Asian population. “We can’t allow this to scare and divide people.” Others wondered how Amess’s two female members of staff – alongside him during the attack – were coping. Jane Riddle, who has lived in Belfairs for more than 50 years, said a neighbour was one of the assistants. “She’s worked for David for years. I think she’s got a good support network and she’s a governor at a local school, but it must be awful,” she said. As the police investigation continued into the night and the pile of flowers outside the church steadily grew, crowds congregated to pay tribute to their former MP. James Duddridge, MP for the neighbouring constituency, addressed the gathering with a microphone, describing how he had been inundated with tributes to Amess and reassured local people that “there is no ongoing threat to Southend”. Later, Stephen Aylen, a former independent councillor for the area, said that the death of “the perfect local MP” had prompted him to reanalyse some of the behaviour he had experienced as a politician. “I’m a nothing but I’ve been pushed up against the wall and punched. I’ve had human shit thrown at me … people are nasty but to pull out a knife is so exceptional,” he said. Yet most of those interviewed by the Observer portrayed Leigh-on-Sea as a place where extreme violence was rare. No longer. From here onwards, their town will be synonymous with the killing of its much-loved MP.\n",
      "Shortly after 9am on Saturday , Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer bent to lay wreaths and, united briefly by grief, turned grimly from the Essex church where Conservative MP Sir David Amess had been killed less than 24 hours earlier. Accompanied by the rumble of helicopters, the political leaders soon left Leigh-on-Sea and a community searching for answers. What made someone kill one of Westminster’s most admired MPs in a town judged one of the country’s best places to live? The man arrested on suspicion of killing the MP is Ali Harbi Ali, a 25-year-old British born man whose family fled to the UK from war ravaged Somalia. He was arrested at the scene on suspicion of murder but was further detained detained under section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000. Counter-terrorism detectives from the Met’s SO15 unit, investigating the killing,moved him yesterday from Essex to a London police station. A warrant of further detention, allowing detectives to hold him until October 22, was granted at Westminster Magistrates’ Court yesterday. Prior to the terror charge, officers from the Metropolitan Police’s counter-terrorism unit said they were investigating “a potential motivation linked to Islamist extremism”. According to multiple sources the man is said not to be on MI5’s vast, evolving database of people of interest. However, he is believed to have been referred to the Prevent programme, the official programme to stop radicalisation. It is reported that his involvement was short. He has no known previous terrorist involvement. Police have said they are not looking for anyone else. Police also raided three addresses in London yesterday, one in Croydon in south London and two others in Kentish Town and Bounds Green in north London. Ali is said to have lived or have family links in the Southend area but had moved to London. On Friday he travelled to Essex by train but told Tory constituency workers he had recently moved to the area and wanted to speak to the MP. Whatever emerges from the investigation, the events soon after noon on Friday have traumatised the people of Leigh-on-Sea and far beyond. Previous Islamist terrorist attacks have prompted a rise in hate crimes, and the police declaration of a terrorist incident has already turned attention to Leigh’s modest Muslim population, which, according to the last census, stood at 1.9% for Southend-on-Sea, which incorporates Leigh and Belfairs, the district where Amess was stabbed to death at a constituency surgery. The Zaidis are one of the area’s most prominent Muslim families and were close friends with Amess. The death of Habib Zaidi, 76, who ran a Belfairs GP surgery before succumbing to Covid-19 last year, was mentioned by Amess in parliament. Their relationship, said Zaidi’s wife, articulated what she believed was the effortless multiculturalism of Leigh-on-Sea. Speaking 100 metres from where Amess was killed, she said: “It’s extremely integrated around here. There’s no race hate, everyone coexists here in peace.” Her son shook his head when asked if the MP’s death could destabilise the area. Further along Eastwood Road North, student Grisharni Raviraj also described a town where, she said, she had experienced no racial disharmony. However, she admitted that already her parents had discussed security concerns in the wake of the tragedy, despite the family not being Muslim. “My parents have warned me, saying the first thing people notice is the colour of my skin,” said Raviraj, who has lived in the area for a decade. Across the road, Obinna said she was convinced that the perpetrator was not local. “This act must have been imported. There is no way this person can be from around here,” she said, gesturing towards the police tape keeping the public from the scene of Amess’s death. Obinna, who has lived in the area for more than 20 years, said she lived around the corner from the Belfairs Methodist Church where the stabbing took place. “Last night, even after what happened, I left my back door open all night,” she added . Meanwhile, a joint statement from all of Southend’s mosques described the fatal stabbing as an “indefensible atrocity”. Published on the Essex Jamme Masjid website, it said: “We look forward to the perpetrator being brought to justice.” Local resident Bhawani Bhardwaj, 74, echoed such sentiments. Stressing that the local south Asian community was “peace-loving”, he said: “If you read the Qu’ran, it says clearly that there shouldn’t be any violence.” He added: “This is the first time something like this has happened in Southend and we’re all really disturbed.” Southend councillor John Lamb, another close friend of Amess, said the attacker was waiting to see the MP then “drew a knife and stabbed him” when he was summoned.

      "Confidential documents leaked to the Observer reveal an extraordinary rift between Boris Johnson and his chancellor, Rishi Sunak, over the potential economic effects of moving towards a zero-carbon economy, with just weeks to go before the crucial Cop26 climate summit. As Johnson prepares to position the UK at the head of global efforts to combat climate change and curb greenhouse gas emissions as host of the Glasgow Cop26 meeting, the documents show the Treasury is warning of serious economic damage to the UK economy and future tax rises if the UK overspends on, or misdirects, green investment. Green experts said the “half-baked” and “one-sided” Treasury net-zero review presented only the costs of action on emissions, rather than the benefits, such as green jobs, lower energy bills and avoiding the disastrous impact of global heating. They said the review could be “weaponised” by climate-change deniers around the world before Cop26, undermining Johnson’s attempts at climate leadership on the global stage. The internal Treasury documents say that while there may be economic benefits to UK companies from swift and appropriate climate action, there is also a danger that economic activity could move abroad if firms found their costs were increasing by more than those of their overseas competitors. The leaked papers are understood to have been produced to accompany a slide show given confidentially to key groups outside government in the last month. The documents state: “The investment required to decarbonise the UK economy is uncertain but could help to improve the UK’s relatively low investment levels and increase productivity. “However, more green investment is likely to attract diminishing returns, reducing the positive impact of ever more investment on GDP. Some green investments could displace other, more productive, investment opportunities. If more productive investments are made earlier in the transition, this risk may be accentuated later in the transition.” On the risk of additional costs to companies from green initiatives, the documents say: “Climate action in the UK can lead to economic activity moving abroad if it directly leads to costs increasing, and it is more profitable to produce in countries with less stringent climate policies.” On the fiscal implications, the documents say the cost of moving towards net zero could mean tax rises because of “the erosion of tax revenue from fossil fuel-related activity”. They say: “The government may need to consider changes to existing taxes and new sources of revenue throughout the transition in order to deliver net zero sustainably, and consistently with the government’s fiscal principles.” Ed Matthew, campaign director at the E3G thinktank, said: “To governments looking to Cop26, this looks unprofessional and embarrassing. The UK is standing in front of the world at Cop26 trying to galvanise ambitious action from every country. If the government has not presented the robust economic case in favour of action, that’s going to significantly undermine those attempts.” The Treasury’s approach is also starkly at odds with that of business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng and the analysis of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) in a report published in July this year. On the costs of moving towards net zero, the OBR said in its report: “Between now and 2050 the fiscal costs of getting to net zero in the UK could be significant, but they are not exceptional ... While unmitigated climate change would spell disaster, the net fiscal costs of moving to net zero emissions by 2050 could be comparatively modest.” The Committee on Climate Change, the government’s statutory adviser, has also repeatedly said the costs of action are small and diminishing, at less than 1% of GDP by 2050, while the costs of inaction are large and rising. While there are concerns over how the costs could fall on poorer households, the CCC chief executive Chris Stark has made clear that ministers can choose to distribute the costs and benefits fairly, through the design of green policies. Whitehall sources said there was a belief that Sunak was keen to position himself as something of a climate-change sceptic in order to boost his popularity with Tory party members, and draw comparisons with Johnson’s green enthusiasms. “Rishi clearly sees an interest in showing he is not really down with this green stuff. He wants Boris to own the whole agenda.” A source at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy confirmed that the Treasury was “kicking back” against many of the green plans being advanced by No 10 and Kwarteng. “They are not climate change deniers but they are emphasising the short-term risks, rather than long-term needs, which is what we are emphasising.” In contrast to the Treasury’s caution, Labour committed at its recent party conference to invest £28bn extra every year until 2030 to secure a “green transition” creating good jobs with decent wages in the process. The leak comes as the government prepares to publish its long-awaited net zero strategy, and heat and buildings strategy, which will contain policies on cutting emissions and creating green jobs, including a ban on new gas boilers from 2035 and grants for householders to move to green heating. The government’s Cop26 president, former business secretary Alok Sharma, is embarking on a frantic last-ditch round of diplomacy, including with Chinese representatives, amid speculation that President Xi Jinping will not attend the talks. The US and the EU are also talking to key high-emitting countries in the final weeks before Cop26, which opens on 31 October. The Treasury said: “The government is committed to tackling climate change and the prime minister has set out an ambitious 10-point plan to help us achieve that. The Treasury is playing a crucial role in this effort, by allocating £12bn to fund the plan, setting up the UK infrastructure bank to invest in net zero, and committing to raise £15bn for projects like zero-emissions buses, offshore wind and schemes to decarbonise homes.”\n",
      "Doctors are warning that accident and emergency departments are on the “edge of a precipice”, with patients forced to wait in ambulances for up to 11 hours outside hospitals. Paramedics across Britain have reported queues of up to 20 ambulances waiting outside hospitals to transfer patients into emergency departments operating at full capacity. Every ambulance service in the country is now at the highest level of alert, the Association of Ambulance Chief Executives (AACE) said this weekend. Martin Flaherty, the organisation’s managing director, said: “[The association] remains extremely concerned about the unprecedented levels of hospital handover delays which are occurring across the UK.” A patient died last Monday after suffering a suspected heart attack in the back of an ambulance which had been queueing for more than two hours outside James Paget University Hospital at Gorleston-on-Sea in Norfolk. A hospital spokesperson said the patient was moved into A&E but “sadly died in the department”. Worcestershire Royal hospital, Royal Shrewsbury hospital, Norfolk and Norwich university hospital and Darlington memorial hospital have experienced some of the longest handover delays. National guidelines say patients should be transferred from an ambulance to an emergency department within 15 minutes. West Midlands ambulance service (WMAS) said its longest handover delay in August and September at the Worcestershire Royal was 11 hours and 46 minutes. It said three crews waited more than 11 hours in August to transfer their patients who stayed in the back of the vehicles. Mark Wibberley, a senior emergency medical technician with East of England ambulance service and Unison Norfolk County lead, said: “The waits can be as long as six hours to hand over patients. It’s not acceptable.” Darlington Memorial Hospital reportedly had queues of up to 15 ambulances this month with crews waiting hours to transfer patients. Dr Ian Higginson, vice-president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said: “The last thing you want when you’re sick, frightened or in distress is to be waiting in an ambulance outside an emergency department. There has been a failure in the NHS to deal with this chronic problem. I am very worried these delays will get worse without effective planning on how to deal with it. It feels like we are on the edge of a precipice in terms of the quality of care we can provide for our patients.” NHS figures published last week revealed that 2.1 million people attended A&E last month, the highest figure ever recorded in September. There were 946,707 answered calls for an ambulance to 999 last month, compared with 713,975 in September 2020, an increase of more than 30%. Figures released to the Observer from the AACE reveal the hours lost to ambulance services due to hospital handover delays of more than an hour had increased from 4,700 hours in April 2021 to more than 35,000 hours last month. Handover delays can worsen ambulance response times, which in England are now the longest since the data was first collected in April 2018. Prof Kailash Chand, a former deputy chair of the British Medical Association, died in July after suffering a cardiac arrest at home in Manchester. It took more than 30 minutes for North West ambulance service to arrive, compared with an average target response time of seven minutes. Chand’s son, Dr Aseem Malhotra, a cardiologist and chair of the charity the Public Health Collaboration, said his father would almost certainly have survived if the ambulance had not been delayed. He later found the service was on the highest level of alert because of the high demand. He said: “These delays are absolutely shocking and there has been a complete failure to inform the public that ambulance services are on the highest level of alert because they are struggling to cope with the number of 999 calls. The system is broken.” The chef and TV presenter Mary Berry, 86, has told how she had to wait three and a half hours for an ambulance after breaking her hip in August. She said she had been “perfectly happy” to wait and was treated at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading. Richard Webber, a paramedic and spokesperson for the College of Paramedics, said many hospitals were at capacity, with delays in discharging patients, and “it backs up and doesn’t allow the ambulances to offload”. Hospitals say their staff are working under extreme pressure with record demands, but are working with NHS partners to reduce handover delay. Matthew Hopkins, chief executive of Worcestershire acute hospitals NHS trust, said: “We are extremely grateful to our WMAS colleagues and local healthcare partners who are working harder than ever to reduce waiting times and ease the problems caused by ambulances being delayed outside our hospitals.” North West ambulance service spokesperson said, “We offer our sincere condolences to Dr Malhotra and his family and can confirm that we have received a formal complaint from him. We are investigating the incident and will liaise with the family to discuss the matter further.” An NHS spokesperson said: “Ambulances responded to a record 76,000 life-threatening call-outs in Septemberan increase of more than 20,000 on the previous high for this month, while 999 took nearly one million calls last month. Please help us to reduce delays by only calling 999 for life-threatening emergencies and contacting NHS 111 online or by phone for other medical assistance and advice.” \n",
      "The husband of jailed British-Iranian aid worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe last night criticised the government’s handling of his wife’s case after it was revealed she had lost her appeal against a second jail sentence in Iran. Richard Ratcliffe accused the government of failing to deal with problems “until they become crises”. His wife was jailed for five years in 2016 after being accused of plotting against the regime. After her release earlier this year, she was charged and sentenced to another year allegedly for spreading propaganda. Following the failure of her appeal in the propaganda case, Zaghari-Ratcliffe can be sent back to prison at any time. Her husband said his wife was “traumatised at the thought of having to go back to jail”. The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, described the loss of the appeal as an “appalling continuation of the cruel ordeal she is going through. Instead of threatening to return Nazanin to prison, Iran must release her permanently so she can return home to her young daughter and family. We are doing all we can to help Nazanin get home … and I will continue to press Iran.” Ratcliffe said he had warned the Foreign Office at a meeting on Friday because he was concerned about the appeal. “The longer we wait, the more chance of bad news. I didn’t expect the next day to get bad news, but we did.” He said those campaigning on behalf of his wife had called for the prime minister, Boris Johnson, to raise the matter with the Iranian president, Ebrahim Raisi, should he accept an invitation to the Cop26 climate change summit. Ratcliffe said Truss spoke to his wife on Saturday. He said he believed the appeal loss would now “focus” UK minds, as she was now “in harm’s way”. “Technically, she’s now just waiting for the phone call, saying, ‘Turn up at this prison on this day’. There’s a sword hanging over us now, it will at some point fall. It’s clearly a signal that the ball’s in the government’s court to do something.” He believes she is being held hostage over a longstanding debt of £400m the UK owes Iran for a cancelled tank deal. Earlier, the Labour MP Tulip Siddiq said Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s sentence of one year plus a one-year travel ban had been “upheld with no court hearing”. The MP for Hampstead and Kilburn urged Boris Johnson to intervene in the case. Siddiq tweeted on Saturday: “Just spoke to my constituent Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s husband, Richard. Nazanin has lost her latest appeal and her sentence of 1 year plus 1 year travel ban is upheld with no court hearing. She could now be returned to prison at any time. The PM must act now to #FreeNazanin.” She said: “This is yet another piece of devastating news for my constituent, her family and the millions around the world who care about her. For Nazanin to face a return to prison after the ordeal she’s been through is nothing short of a catastrophe. “It seems that every time we dare to hope that Nazanin might soon be free, there is another dreadful setback that puts freedom out of sight. Whatever the prime minister has been doing to free Nazanin is clearly not working. “It’s time for the UK government to pay the debt we owe to Iran, stand up to their despicable hostage-taking and finally get Nazanin home.” The Foreign Office has been contacted for comment.\n",
      "Matt Hancock, the former UK health secretary, will no longer become a special envoy for the United Nations, after the job offer was withdrawn. Hancock said on Tuesday he was “honoured” to be working with the UN’s economic commission for Africa (Uneca) to help the continent recover from the pandemic. However, campaigners objected to the appointment because of his record in government during the coronavirus crisis, and on Friday the UN’s official spokesperson said the appointment would not be taken forward. The Uneca has since removed the press release from its website announcing Hancock’s appointment to the unpaid role. Hancock claimed on Saturday that the offer had been withdrawn because of a technicality. In a statement, he said: “The UN have written to me to explain that a technical UN rule has subsequently come to light which states that sitting members of parliament cannot also be UN special representatives. “Since I am committed to continuing to serve as MP for West Suffolk, this means I cannot take up the position.” However, there are previous instances of sitting MPs taking up UN posts: former prime minister Gordon Brown was appointed as a special envoy in 2012. The Uneca had lavished praise on Hancock’s abilities, saying it had asked him to take on the role because of his “economic policy expertise, experience operating financial markets at the Bank of England and in-depth understanding of government and multilateral through his various ministerial cabinet roles”. The release quoted the commission’s under secretary general, Vera Songwe, saying: “We are confident that his expertise and leadership will offer immediate and long-term impact particularly in effecting long-term financial growth.” Hancock was also quoted in the Uneca release as saying he was “thrilled” to be joining the organisation, adding: “I care deeply about making this happen not only because of the strong economic opportunity but because we share a view of Africa as a strategic long-term partner.” The withdrawal of the offer will come as a blow to Hancock’s efforts to rebuild his career after resigning as health secretary in June, following revelations that he had been having an affair with his parliamentary aide during lockdown. Songwe is said to have appointed Hancock after Nimco Ali, a Home Office adviser on violence against women, introduced her to the MP. Hancock spoke at a fringe event at the Conservative party conference this month, saying he wanted to help bring private investment to Africa. The announcement of his new role was greeted with support from senior Conservatives including Michael Gove, Sajid Javid and Damian Green. However, NGOs and activists objected to the appointment, which was announced on the same day that MPs published a report saying thousands of people had died because the government had failed to lock down early enough, while Hancock was health secretary. Global Justice Now said in a tweet: “Matt Hancock blocked international efforts to allow low- and middle-income countries to produce their own Covid-19 vaccines, leading to millions of global south deaths. The audacity of this man claiming to help African nations and promote sustainable development is sickening.” The UN secretary general’s official spokesperson, Stéphane Dujarric, said: “Mr Hancock’s appointment by the UN economic commission for Africa is not being taken forward. ECA has advised him of the matter.” UN sources indicated that rules on conflicts of interest had been a factor in secretary general António Guterres’s decision to withdraw the offer.\n",
      "A man has been charged with sexual offences after allegedly kidnapping a teenage girl while impersonating a police officer. David Peter Young, 32, a chef from Ifield, is due to appear at Brighton magistrates court on Saturday. Young is charged with kidnap with intent to commit a sexual offence, kidnap, impersonating a police officer and two breaches of a sexual harm prevention order over the incident, which allegedly happened on Wednesday morning. According to Sussex police, a 14-year-old girl was approached on her way to school in the Three Bridges area in Crawley, West Sussex, by a man wearing a yellow hi-vis jacket. He took her to a nearby area away from the road and searched her clothing, before leaving the scene on a bicycle. The girl was unharmed and is receiving support. Since Wayne Couzens, a serving Metropolitan police officer, used police powers and equipment in his kidnap, rape and murder of Sarah Everard, there have been concerns over women being approached by lone policemen. Sussex police superintendent Marc Clothier said there would be more uniformed patrols in the area in the incident’s aftermath, and he encouraged members of the public to speak to officers. He added: “We understand some people may want additional reassurance when interacting with a lone police officer and when you are alone. “If this is the case, genuine officers can use their police radio on loud speaker to talk to the operator in the police control room.

      "President Joe Biden is likely to abandon a clean energy programme that was the centrepiece of his efforts to tackle greenhouse gas emissions at home, US media reported, because of opposition from a swing-vote Democratic senator from a state with a historically large coal industry. Funding to replace coal- and gas-fired plants with wind, solar and nuclear generation was part of a massive budget bill that Biden is struggling to get through Congress. The New York Times reported that White House staff members are now rewriting the legislation without the $150bn clean energy provision, on the expectation that they will not be able to pass the original version because of staunch opposition from the West Virginia senator Joe Manchin. The news is the latest blow to hopes for the United Nations summit on climate change, Cop26, due to be held in Glasgow in two weeks’ time. China, the world’s top emitter of greenhouse gases, last week revealed plans to build more coal-fired power plants, and hinted it may be rethinking its timetable to cut emissions, as it struggles with an energy crisis amid slowing economic growth. It also seems increasingly clear that President Xi Jinping, China’s most powerful leader in many years, will not attend the Cop26 gathering. His absence will undermine hopes that dealmaking could get extra impetus from a personal gathering of leaders. For the Glasgow summit, which has been delayed by a year because of the pandemic, countries are expected to produce revised national emissions-cutting targets to help the world limit heating to 1.5C, the legally binding goal of the 2015 Paris climate agreement. The UK presidency also hopes to focus on three other areas to meet climate goals: climate finance, phasing out coal, and nature-based solutions. Scientists estimate that emissions must be reduced by 45% by 2030, compared with 2010 levels, and from there to net zero emissions by 2050, if the world is to have a good chance of remaining within the threshold agreed in Paris. The UK and other major players have already accepted that they will not be able to win commitments for such sweeping cuts from big emitters at Glasgow, so instead London is focused on making enough progress to “keep 1.5C alive” as a potential goal. British diplomats say they are “cautiously optimistic” about overall progress, with a deal on providing $100bn to developing countries expected to be sealed and some advances on an agreement to halt deforestation and the destruction of nature. Last week more than 20 countries joined a pledge to cut methane, a potent greenhouse gas. The UK, the US and the EU have also embarked on a frantic round of climate diplomacy in a last-ditch attempt to bring key countries into a deal. But the latest news from the US and China, the world’s top emitters of greenhouse gases, will raise questions about how much progress the meeting can make towards core emissions goals. America is historically the world’s largest producer of greenhouse gasses and the US clean energy project was set to be the cornerstone of American efforts at Glasgow to push other countries to move faster on tackling climate change. Biden has called for urgent action on climate, in a definitive break with his predecessor Donald Trump, who rejected the international scientific consensus on a world heating up, and hobbled global efforts to do something about it. But if the president is forced to abandon the clean energy provision, it may damage international faith in Washington’s ability to turn rhetoric into domestic action on climate change. It would certainly make it harder for climate envoy John Kerry and his team to push other countries to make costly efforts to cut their own emissions. The electricity sector produces about a quarter of US greenhouse gases, and the infrastructure programme was meant to trigger a long-term shift in the country’s energy sector that would endure beyond Biden’s presidency. It proposed incentives for utilities to clean up their energy production and penalties for remaining reliant on fossil fuels. Manchin, who has said he strongly opposes the clean energy deal, has personal financial ties to the coal industry and represents a state where mining, although shrinking, still employs thousands of people.\n",
      "Robert Durst, the wealthy New York real estate heir and convicted murderer, is on a ventilator after testing positive for Covid-19, his attorney has confirmed to the Los Angeles Times. Durst’s attorney Dick DeGuerin told the newspaper his client was in “very bad condition” during the sentencing hearing and “was having difficulty breathing and he was having difficulty communicating”. DeGuerin confirmed to the Times that Durst had been hospitalized and placed on a ventilator in a wing of USC medical center under the watch of the Los Angeles county sheriff’s department where he has been through out his recent murder trial. The announcement of a Covid-19 infection comes two days after Durst, 78, was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of Susan Berman in 2000, a slaying possibly tied to the 1982 disappearance Durst’s wife, Kathie McCormack Durst. Durst appeared frail and at times confused at trial. His lawyers said at Thursday’s sentencing they plan to appeal his conviction. The latest development in the Durst story comes a month after a Los Angeles jury convicted Durst of first-degree murder in the 2000 killing. At trial, prosecutors argued that Durst had shot Berman at point-blank range in her home to prevent her from telling police what she knew about the disappearance of Durst’s wife, whose body has never been found. Six years ago, a Netflix documentary series The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst brought new public attention to the accusations against Durst. He was arrested on the eve of the airing of the last episode, in which Durst appeared to confess to the killings, saying to himself, “What the hell did I do? … Killed them all, of course.” The Berman case verdict was the first homicide conviction for Durst, who has also been linked to the death of neighbor Morris Black, whose body parts were found In Galveston Bay, Texas. Durst had fled to Texas after Berman’s killing and lived under an assumed name, Dorothy Ciner, and regularly wore a woman’s wig, dresses and high heels. Claiming self-defense, Durst was acquitted of Black’s murder in 2001, despite admitting to dismembering his body.\n",

      "An Argentinian judge investigating cases that happened during the Franco dictatorship in Spain has indicted a former Spanish minister on four counts of homicide. Judge Maria Servini de Cuba, sitting in Buenos Aires, issued the ruling against Rodolfo Martín Villa, 87, interior minister between 1976 and 1979. The judge wrote that she considered Martín Villa “the prima facie perpetrator criminally responsible for the crime of aggravated homicide, repeated on at least four occasions, of which Pedro María Martínez Ocio, Romualdo Barroso Chaparro, Francisco Aznar Clemente and Germán Rodríguez Saíz were victims”. Martín Villa told the Spanish newspaper ABC: “I am calm. I will appeal.” Spain passed an amnesty law in 1977 that pardoned crimes committed by the Franco dictatorship. Hundreds of Spaniards have tried to get around this by turning to an Argentinian court, under the principle of universal justice, to address crimes committed against them and their families during General Francisco Franco’s 36-year rightwing dictatorship. Franco ruled over Spain from 1939 to 1975.  Servini wrote that Martín Villa had played a key role in the repressive structures of the dictatorship, which continued in the years immediately after Franco’s death in 1975. “It is great news for the victims, who have been claiming for many years,” said Máximo Castex, a lawyer for the relatives of the victims. The judge ordered Martín Villa, who lives in Madrid, to be detained but said it was unlikely to happen. Fernando Goldaracena, the ex-minister’s lawyer, did not reply to requests for comment.\n",

      "On a Friday in autumn 2006, local newspapers and prosecutors in Italy’s south-western region of Campania received the same anonymous letter. Computer-typed and delivered by hand in the early morning, it detailed the Neapolitan Mafia’s plan to execute a 26-year-old Italian writer. His name was Roberto Saviano and his book, Gomorrah, a devastating denunciation of the Camorra’s criminal activity, was on its way to becoming a bestseller. The unpublished letter, seen by the Observer, refers to a meeting held in a betting office in Casal di Principe, Saviano’s hometown, in which local bosses, known as some of the most violent in the Camorra, decreed that Saviano must die, saying that his murder would take place “when the waters are calm”. The letter stated that Saviano “must be punished”, that the bosses knew where his mother lived, that they’d been following him for weeks and that two hitmen had already been commissioned to murder him. It explained that “the weapons that will be used for the execution have already been placed” in an associate’s house. It concluded with a threat in bold type and underlined: “If he shuts up, he’ll be spared.” A lot has changed since that day. Gomorrah, which has sold more than 10 million copies worldwide, has been translated into more than 50 languages and inspired an award-winning film and a TV series that ran for five seasons. The Casalesi clan, once one of the most powerful Mafia groups in Europe, is in decline and many of the mobsters are now behind bars. Saviano, who is now 42, did not give in to the threats. He never kept quiet. He continued to denounce the Camorra’s business dealings and point a spotlight on one of the most powerful criminal organisations in the world. But although he survived an assassination plot, Saviano has nonetheless paid a high price. Since that autumn day in 2006, when the Italian authorities informed the writer that his life was in danger, he has lived in hiding, emerging only under police escort. Since then, he has not spent more than a few nights in the same place, and often sleeps in police barracks. He cannot go out alone, take a stroll in busy places or go to the sea. I visited him on a recent Monday in a minuscule apartment in Rome. Outside the building, two men meet me and escort me up, while another remains on guard at the entrance. The first thing you notice are the thousands of books that line the walls. The second is the lack of windows. Both, in some way, seem to represent the man of letters forced to live like a prisoner. Saviano’s eyes speak of sleepless nights, and his face is tense – the consequences of a life lived, since 2006, in a constant state of agitation. “A part of me is always at war,” he says. “At war with the world, at war with the Camorra, at war with myself. Sometimes I’ve even thought that dying would be better than living like this. Death would be more acceptable than this constant pressure, the state of anxiety and emptiness in which I’ve been living for so long.” Fifteen years under police escort is a milestone and, for this reason, three armoured vehicles and seven policemen await us downstairs. For two days, the Observer will accompany Saviano on a road trip from Rome to Naples, into Camorra strongholds, some of which he hadn’t visited in years. He left as a young man and returns as the most famous living Italian writer, and international symbol of the anti-mafia struggle – hated by the right for his pro-refugee pronouncements and by some of his fellow citizens who accuse him of having tainted the image of his home territory. We set off in the first armoured vehicle. Saviano and I are sitting in the back. Two police officers are in front. “When I wrote Gomorrah, I knew I was writing stories that many reporters already knew,” says Saviano, who last week launched a graphic novel about his life illustrated by Israeli comic book artist Asaf Hanuka. “But I also knew those stories had never received an anthropological interpretation. I knew I had something literary in my hands, and I knew it would be explosive. But I never could’ve imagined what would happen next.” After Gomorrah was published, Saviano started to receive mysterious phone calls: the phone would ring, but when he answered no one would speak. Then the threatening letters started arriving. One day, his mother found in her mailbox a photo of Saviano with a gun pointed at his temple: above was written “sentenced”. In September 2006, during an anti-mafia rally in Casal di Principe, a town where it’s said there are more guns than forks, Saviano challenged the bosses from the stage, calling out their names, and shouting: “You don’t belong here! Get out!”, inciting the crowd to rise up against the clan. This event, according to mafia turncoats, infuriated the bosses, who made a plan to assassinate the writer in an attack on Christmas day, 2008, on the motorway between Rome and Naples. “I named names, in front of their people, which was the same as taking God’s name in vain”, says Saviano. “In their eyes, I committed a mortal sin.” According to witnesses, the Camorra was planning to kill Saviano in a spectacular blast reminiscent of the 1992 Capaci massacre, when the Sicilian mafia killed the anti-mafia magistrate Giovanni Falcone, his wife, and the members of his police escort with 300kg of dynamite that left a crater on the motorway near Palermo. The authorities took the threats seriously. “At first I thought I’d be under protection for two or three days, and that soon I’d be able to go back to my normal life.” He looks out of the window as we race past the so-called “Land of Fire”, an area in the countryside of the province of Caserta, where the Camorra buried tons of toxic waste beneath roads and land. “I realised that the situation was more serious than I thought when, during a war between rival Camorra clans, [the police] took me to a secure location on a remote island. They put me in a house that was only accessible by sea. There was no mobile phone service, and to make calls a police agent had to ferry me out to sea.” Under such tight security, it’s complicated even to go to the toilet. An hour into our journey, Saviano asks the agents to pull over at a motorway service station so he can use the bathroom. Two men alight from one car and check that the bathroom is secure. Then they motion Saviano to enter, while the other agents remain outside to guard the door. “The price I’ve paid is higher than anything I could have imagined,” says Saviano, getting back in the car. No crafty cigarette break. “But what really bothers me is seeing my family have to move from town to town. I feel guilty every day of my life for this.” Over the years, several European countries have offered Saviano protection, including a Scandinavian country which offered him asylum. In exchange, Saviano would be required to give up his fight against organised crime: no more interviews, no compromising articles. “I’ve thought long about leaving Italy,” he admits. “But in the end, a sort of idealism has always prevailed. I was committed to changing the status quo. I wanted to fuck the Camorra. If I could go back, I don’t know if I’d do it again.” Saviano has attempted to live a normal life. At one time he lived in New York, where the US government, to protect him, gave him a new identity as David Dannon. He realised it didn’t work when, inside a building in Manhattan, a man greeted him: ‘Ah! The Italian writer!’” “Even when I was abroad, in some countries I was forced to live under police guard,” he says. “At a certain point I was being transferred to cities I didn’t even know existed. One of the days I felt the freest in years was in London, when I met Julian Assange. I went from the airport to the city centre by myself, with no one escorting me, and it was spectacular.” Around noon, we arrive in Castel Volturno, in a landscape of uncommon beauty between Mount Dragone and the island of Ischia. On this idyllic coastline, 24,000 illegal constructions have been built. Thousands have been confiscated, and the derelict ruins are spread over 17 miles of beach – like archaeological artefacts from a post-apocalyptic disaster. Many of the houses there belong to members of the Camorra. Here, in 2008, killers from the Casalesi clan murdered six African immigrants. They were chosen at random to send a message to the African drug gangs. The massacre inspired the episode African Blood in the first season of the TV series Gomorrah. Saviano hadn’t been to Castel Volturno for years. The escort vehicles stop at the ruins of an abandoned tourist village, a short distance from the seashore. We decide to stretch our legs along the beach. The sky is cloudy and the sea rough. Saviano strolls along the beach, breathing the sea air. The next stop is tense: Scampia, one of the biggest drug-dealing centres in Europe. For decades, Scampia’s rundown, sail-shaped tower blocks, known as the Vele, have been the scene of bloody wars between Camorra clans. Erected between 1965 and 1980, these buildings were designed to replace the slums of the medieval city centre of Naples. The idea was to recreate housing complexes that would evoke the narrow alleys of the “old city” to encourage community relations. But, because of corruption, many of the blocks were left unfinished, and the alleys were soon transformed into a warren for dealing heroin. Two additional armoured vehicles join our escort to accompany us to the Vele. Saviano gets out briefly – just enough time to have a quick chat with the officers at the police station in Scampia and leave in haste. He isn’t well liked around here. On the walls of the neighbourhood are written slogans like “Scampia is not Gomorrah”. It’s not only the bosses who don’t like his presence here; many residents have expressed their displeasure. And yet, if Scampia today has changed, if the state has intervened to rid the quarter of several mafiosi, it’s also because Saviano brought attention to the place. While Saviano can count on millions of supporters, he is also the target of thousands of haters, the majority of whom accuse him of having earned millions of euros by tarnishing Naples. And there are those who argue that Saviano does not need an escort; that, if the Camorra had really wanted to kill him, they would have already done so. The far-right ex-minister of the interior, Matteo Salvini, threatened to remove Saviano’s escort after the writer attacked him for his anti-immigration policies. ‘‘Many people have forgotten how this story began and why I am under escort today,’’ says Saviano. “Many think being under escort is a privilege. As if it were my decision. Some people even see the escort as a sign of success, but I am not a hero. I have never felt like a hero.” Salman Rushdie, who was forced into hiding after receiving death threats over his novel The Satanic Verses, said when he met Saviano in 2008 at the Nobel Academy in Sweden: “People blame me for being alive – to keep going to parties or to write books. They will blame you for your life.” “For the people, I am a martyr who is not dead,” Saviano says. “They blame me for still being alive. It might have been better if they had killed me. I thought about that. I often still think so. “In the darkest, most disheartening moments, I feel like everything I’ve fought for has been for nothing. It happens when you feel you cannot free yourself from this life. It happened to me, recently, after the ruling of the Court of Rome, condemning the mafia men who had threatened me.” Last May, judges ruled that a Camorra mafia boss, Francesco Bidognetti, and his lawyer had threatened Saviano’s life, and that of a journalistic colleague – Rosaria Capacchione. It was a landmark ruling – the first time someone had been held accountable for Saviano’s plight. As our journey draws to a close at the foot of Vesuvius, in front of the sea, and with the beauty of Naples unfolding before us, Saviano says: ‘‘I should have celebrated that ruling. The boss who condemned me to this life was finally sentenced. But, no. I thought, I was only 26 when they sentenced me to a life under armed guard. It is said that, before you die, all the beautiful things you have done in your life flash by you. At that moment, after the ruling, I relived everything I have not been able to do in the last 15 years.’’ It’s time to say goodbye. Before returning to his armoured vehicle, Saviano waves his hand with a smile. A smile that seems to hide his anger; a smile that reminds me of the final line of Gomorrah: “Damned bastards, I’m still alive.’”\n",

The far-right ex-minister of the interior, Matteo Salvini, threatened to remove Saviano’s escort after the writer attacked him for his anti-immigration policies. ‘‘Many people have forgotten how this story began and why I am under escort today,’’ says Saviano. “Many think being under escort is a privilege. As if it were my decision. Some people even see the escort as a sign of success, but I am not a hero. I have never felt like a hero.” Salman Rushdie, who was forced into hiding after receiving death threats over his novel The Satanic Verses, said when he met Saviano in 2008 at the Nobel Academy in Sweden: “People blame me for being alive – to keep going to parties or to write books. They will blame you for your life.” “For the people, I am a martyr who is not dead,” Saviano says. “They blame me for still being alive. It might have been better if they had killed me. I thought about that. I often still think so. “In the darkest, most disheartening moments, I feel like everything I’ve fought for has been for nothing. It happens when you feel you cannot free yourself from this life. It happened to me, recently, after the ruling of the Court of Rome, condemning the mafia men who had threatened me.” Last May, judges ruled that a Camorra mafia boss, Francesco Bidognetti, and his lawyer had threatened Saviano’s life, and that of a journalistic colleague – Rosaria Capacchione. It was a landmark ruling – the first time someone had been held accountable for Saviano’s plight. As our journey draws to a close at the foot of Vesuvius, in front of the sea, and with the beauty of Naples unfolding before us, Saviano says: ‘‘I should have celebrated that ruling. The boss who condemned me to this life was finally sentenced. But, no. I thought, I was only 26 when they sentenced me to a life under armed guard. It is said that, before you die, all the beautiful things you have done in your life flash by you. At that moment, after the ruling, I relived everything I have not been able to do in the last 15 years.’’ It’s time to say goodbye. Before returning to his armoured vehicle, Saviano waves his hand with a smile. A smile that seems to hide his anger; a smile that reminds me of the final line of Gomorrah: “Damned bastards, I’m still alive.’”\n",
      "Sex sells. But finding a bank willing to take the money is a little more complicated. That is the hard lesson learned by people such as Genevieve LeJeune, the founder of Skirt Club, which runs a 16,000-strong community for bisexual and bi-curious women and hosts events – including sex parties – around the world. LeJeune says she had been a premier customer with HSBC her entire life and did not bother to shop around when she opened her business account in 2013. She said she told the bank that she ran a community for the “B” in LGBTQ+ and was not chased for any further information. “I didn’t think for one minute they would have an issue with what the business was about. And why would they be concerned, as long as I’m cashflow positive and I do all the right things, and it’s completely legal?” All of a sudden, in 2019, her business accounts were shut and the funds frozen. She has spent more than four years battling HSBC for access to more than £20,000 trapped in those accounts. She was never offered an explanation, and only regained control of the cash this spring after complaining to the Financial Ombudsman Service. Her suspicion was that the bank did not want to be associated with her business as Skirt Club’s signature “play parties” gained more press coverage. HSBC says it does not have a blanket ban on sex-related business customers, but considers each client on a “case by case” basis. So LeJeune was not surprised when she heard that OnlyFans, the online subscription platform known for hosting adult content, blamed banks for its decision to ban pornography from its site last month. While OnlyFans later secured an agreement allowing sex workers to continue posting photos and videos, others in the industry have not been so lucky. Tess Herrmann, a researcher at the UK charity National Ugly Mugs (NUM), which provides support to sex workers, is investigating access to financial services across the adult industry, which covers stripping, pornography, escort and dominatrix work, and “full sexual service”, more commonly referred to as prostitution. “We see a lot of discrimination, specifically from banks and financial institutions, where sex workers are not able to open business accounts even though their escort business is a business, but it’s not seen as such,” she says. She has also heard of both personal and business accounts being shut down, money being seized, and sex workers being refused loans and overdrafts. “The stigma surrounding sex work affects every part of a sex worker’s life, which includes their financial life, their financial decisions and their access to financial services,” Herrmann says. Full-service sex work is legal in the UK. Banking the proceeds of sex work is not a criminal offence, and does not constitute money laundering under UK law. However, the parameters are narrow, given that many related activities, such as soliciting in a public place, operating brothels, pimping and kerb crawling, are unlawful. There are no specific regulators for sex workers, or for the pornography and adult entertainment industries. This means there are no officials to certify that work is being done within the rules, which in turn makes it harder for private companies such as banks to assess potential customers. The potential risks are high: they could include exposure to child abuse images, trafficking, organised crime, modern slavery, or money laundering. Extra checks can be expensive and more difficult to justify for some lenders, forcing some banks to introduce full bans on sex workers. Even the Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates banking, does not have policies outlining how to serve the adult entertainment industry, while industry body UK Finance does not provide any guidance for its members on the issue, saying that each bank will take a view depending on their commercial and risk appetite. But Natasha Mulvihill, a senior lecturer in criminology at the Centre for Gender and Violence Research at the University of Bristol, says that while banks might have valid concerns about the risks, handing oversight on such a contentious topic to the private sector can be problematic. “Are private sector companies the best arbiters of morality? Their judgments are always going to be based ultimately on profit.”  While high street banks may seem more risk-averse, upstart fintechs are also cautious about the industry. Following its troubles with HSBC, Skirt Club turned to Revolut, but after only a year it issued a 30-day notice for LeJeune to collect her cash before shutting her account without explanation. Revolut declined to comment, but its policy states that it does not accept adult entertainment or pornography businesses as customers. It is not clear whether there was a mistake in the company’s processing of Skirt Club’s customer details. LeJeune now banks with Chester-based CardOneMoney, a lender that offers accounts to higher-risk customers for a fee. Sarah Kocianski, a fintech expert and head of strategic insights at startup funder Founders Factory, says that companies like Revolut, Monzo and Starling, which have yet to turn an annual profit, may be hesitant to take on riskier clients such as sex workers – or even CBD and cannabis-related companies – that require more work and cost to monitor. “While they do want to help underserved communities, they are not in a position to,” she says. “I don’t think any of them want to accidentally step out of line.” The challenge is where that leaves sex-related businesses, or more vulnerable independent sex workers who face further risks by not having access to banking. Aside from the constant fear about having an account shut, it can also affect their ability to collect benefits, prove income when renting a home, and even pay the right taxes. Business accounts also add an extra level of security for sex workers who don’t want to share their real name with clients, which can be quite dangerous, Herrmann says. This year, 30-year-old escort Charlotte Edwards made headlines when she started a campaign to guarantee sex workers fair access to banking, after she was denied a Covid loan from a scheme intended for small businesses. The bank in question, Santander, changed its mind after interventions from the all-party parliamentary group on fair business banking.  Edwards is now considering suing Santander for indirect discrimination. She believes banks are “discriminating against an already marginalised group who make a precarious living”. “By making sex workers poorer with less access to resources such as banking services and business platforms, they are actually contributing to people – especially women – staying within sex work but with far less protection and putting them at risk,” she says. Santander does not serve businesses in sectors such as the adult entertainment industry, a policy it says is meant to “protect some of the most vulnerable citizens from risk of abuse, including human trafficking”. However, that policy can be challenged. “Departures from the policy are assessed on a case-by-case basis and can be approved when the bank is comfortable that such a departure would not pose harm to a prospective customer,” a spokesperson says. Excluding sex workers from the financial sector could also push them towards the informal economy. “If sex workers move to cryptocurrencies and other ways of being paid, like gift cards, it is not helpful for proving their income, and it could be higher risk for them,” Mulvihill says. Skirt Club is already considering turning to bitcoin to keep running. “Banks are not on my side, they’re not here to help my business,” says LeJeune. “Why would I stick with a high street bank any more?”\n",

      "One by one, they tackle the steeply winding path to Penrhyn Castle, pausing halfway to admire the view over a sparkling blue sea. Extended families grapple with pushchairs and picnic cool boxes; there are dapper older gentlemen in panama hats, and panting labradors. A blackboard at the entrance advertises traditional games every Thursday, while the gift shop is a soothing vision of gardening tools, tea towels and jars of chutney. As Eleanor Harding, the National Trust’s thoughtful young assistant curator for Wales, enters the castle’s ornate library, a volunteer guide says brightly: “No negative comments today!” Over the past year, the trust has attracted its fair share of those. An institution best known for stately homes, scones and bracing walks has found itself plunged into an unlikely culture war over how the history it is charged with preserving for the nation should be interpreted. Years of minor grumbling about its efforts to move with the times – or, as a leaked internal document last summer put it, improve on an “outdated mansion experience” – erupted into a full-blown row in September last year over a report tracing its properties’ connections to colonialism and slavery. Published in the aftermath of a summer of Black Lives Matter protests, which saw the statue of a slaver pushed into Bristol harbour and Winston Churchill’s statue on Whitehall boarded up for its protection, it brought together three years’ work exploring the histories of 93 estates. Some were built on the proceeds of slavery – Penrhyn’s original owners made their fortune from sugar plantations in Jamaica – while others had been home to abolitionists. Powis Castle on the English-Welsh border made the list for holding spoils of war brought back by the military commander Clive of India, while Rudyard Kipling’s former Sussex home earned its entry for his writings on empire. But it was the inclusion of Churchill’s home at Chartwell, Kent, on grounds including his early opposition to independence for India, that really put the cat among the pigeons. “A clique of powerful, privileged liberals must not be allowed to rewrite our history in their image,” thundered 28 members of the Common Sense Group of Tory backbenchers, a rightwing grouping founded to counter what it regards as “woke” thinking, in a letter to the Daily Telegraph accusing the trust of having “tarnished one of Britain’s greatest sons”. The then chair of the Charity Commission, former Conservative cabinet minister Tina Stowell, promised to investigate whether the trust had strayed from its charitable purpose (the commission later cleared it of doing so). Even Oliver Dowden, then culture secretary, declared that roping in Churchill would “surprise and disappoint people”. Claims that the trust was haemorrhaging members and purging dissenting staff followed, many under the byline of the influential Spectator columnist Charles Moore. A group called Restore Trust – a rebel alliance of disgruntled members seeking to oust senior National Trust leaders – has now tabled a series of resolutions for the charity’s annual general meeting later this month, including one demanding the trust consult its army of volunteers before changing the way a property is presented. The trust has weathered public controversies before, over everything from demands to ban foxhunting on its land in the 1990s to lowering the sugar in its flapjack recipes three years ago. But this feels uglier, and more intense. The trust’s director general, Hilary McGrady, received at least one death threat following the report. Corinne Fowler, a professor of postcolonial literature at the University of Leicester, who co-authored it with the trust’s head curator, Sally-Anne Huxtable, and others, was advised for her own safety not to go out walking alone. The charity seems to have become a lightning rod for the boiling emotions of a nation in flux, racked by arguments over national identity, social justice, pride and guilt. Yet presiding over it all is McGrady, whose manner is as calm and soothing as a stroll round a herbaceous border. Having grown up on a smallholding not far from Belfast during the Troubles, she is perhaps more used to navigating conflicting histories than most. “It’s been the perfect storm in many respects, hasn’t it?” she says resignedly down a phone line from rural Somerset. “People have had to get used to what’s going on with Brexit, people having to get used to Covid, the political agenda, levelling up – there are so many things in the mix that are creating this febrile atmosphere. I think we did fall foul of a period of time in the last year when the world was going slightly bonkers.” But why should the trust be a target? “I think it’s one of the steadying reminders of what’s good about life – people like the consistency,” she says. “And then they were reading this stuff, going: ‘Oh my goodness, they’re changing this thing that I absolutely love.’ That’s what frustrated me, because actually I’m not changing anything. What I’m trying to do is improve and constantly build – take nothing away but just add more interest.” A year on, the trust still has more than 5.4 million members, numbers that no political party can dream of matching. During the pandemic, many drew comfort from walking its peaks and fells, holding outdoor family reunions in its parklands, or holidaying in its beauty spots. But the row hasn’t gone away. At its heart lies a tug of war between people who don’t want politics intruding on a nice day out, and those arguing that politics were there all along, for those who cared to look. The vast dining table at Penrhyn Castle is set for a banquet, groaning with crystal and family silver. Gazing down from the wall, as if surveying his bounty, is an enormous oil painting of Richard Pennant, the first Baron Penrhyn and an 18th-century MP for Liverpool. But something is amiss. The middle of the table is bare, apart from a battered box labelled “Jamaica papers”. And just below the painting stands a bouquet of white chrysanthemums, whose handwritten card dedicates them to the enslaved people “whose blood and sweat and tears contributed to the wealth that built this castle”. The effect is as if someone has burst into a dinner party and thrown down a bloody gauntlet to the hosts. This is the heart of the What a World! exhibition, Eleanor Harding’s attempt to foreground a history unusually well preserved in the family archive that Richard Pennant’s descendants gave to Bangor University in the 1930s, including records of prices paid for slaves on its six plantations. Built in 1820, the castle sits in what the heritage consultant Dr Marian Gwyn (who has researched the archive for the trust) calls a “slave landscape”. The family’s plantation wealth, plus compensation received when slavery was abolished, was ploughed into a vast estate stretching from Bangor on the north Wales coast into Snowdonia. That money bought fine art and furniture for the castle. But it also built houses and pubs, roads and railways, chapels and schools; it drained farmland and industrialised the family’s slate quarry near Bethesda, bringing jobs and prosperity but leaving a new legacy of bitterness. The Great Penrhyn Quarry Strike of 1900-3, called after the Pennant family rejected workers’ demands for better pay and conditions, became the longest-running industrial dispute in British history. Strike-breakers, known as bradwyr or traitors, were ostracised for years afterwards by their neighbours; families were torn apart or driven away. Some local people still refuse to enter the castle, which was seen as symbolising oppression. Six years ago, the trust began devising a strategy to entice them back and introduce tourists to this richly complex story. The Jamaica box was always part of the exhibition, which features local children’s poems responding to objects found in the house. But the flowers arrived unexpectedly this summer via a young black academic named April-Louise Pennant, seeking answers about her family history. Pennant remains a common surname in Jamaica, although, as Harding explains, it’s unclear why. “Is it that after emancipation the British said, ‘You need surnames’ and the slaves were either given or picked the surnames of the people they worked for? Of course, another possibility is rape.” Pennant, a newly graduated PhD student whose research has focused on black feminist ideology and critical race theory, says going to the castle was both “a professional and a personal journey”. Her grandparents came to Britain from Jamaica with the Windrush migration, and she remembers being told their name was Welsh in origin. But it wasn’t until she moved to Wales recently, to work for the devolved government, that she made the connection with Penrhyn. Where once only one line of Pennants was represented in the dining room, now there are two. She laid the flowers because, to her, Penrhyn is a monument: “There would be no castle without slavery, there would be no quarry without slavery. I just thought that my ancestors had not been honoured.” The estate was given to the trust in lieu of inheritance tax in 1953, but the family retained some of the land, and visiting it evoked raw emotions that Pennant is still struggling to process. The trust promised that her card would remain displayed when the flowers died, but she wonders if that is enough. “I’d like to see more scrutiny of why these places were given to the National Trust and the fact that there’s this huge reparations movement – it’s not just about money, it’s about justice. How is it that the slave owners got compensation whereas someone like myself didn’t get anything, and we can’t even get acknowledgment?” Several of her friends, she says, are now keen to trace their own roots; ultimately, she wants to know which part of Africa her own ancestors were taken from. Most visitors have welcomed the exhibition, Harding says, and some have been deeply moved. But she estimates every castle volunteer has fielded at least one angry outburst. “We have people who are frustrated at the way the world is going and changes to the status quo, who are coming to Penrhyn, knowing what they’re going to see and almost needing it as a place to vent their anger,” she says. Others let rip anonymously on TripAdvisor, where “Shropshire Lad” from Shrewsbury complains of “an amazing building, gardens and history ruined by an unremitting display of wokeness”, while Alan M compares “the narrow (and oh so fashionable) angle taken to present a complex subject” to communist rewritings of history. Mike from Tonbridge rages: “Give us what we visited for and paid for – History!” But whose history, exactly? Corinne Fowler, co-author of the colonialism and slavery report, first began collaborating with the trust five years ago on her Colonial Countryside project, which saw children producing creative writing reflecting on properties linked to empire. She is evidently scarred by last September’s backlash, but agrees to answer questions by email. Her report argues that grand country houses are innately political, thanks to a 1711 law limiting House of Commons membership to men with a significant income from the land, which made estate ownership key to legislative power for more than a century. Have we had an overly cosy view of these properties in the past? “Country houses have become places where you go to switch off, walk your dog and admire designed landscapes,” Fowler says. “Nobody’s going to worry about learning familiar facts on their visit – that the house belonged to an MP.” But being confronted with history you didn’t learn at school can, she argues, feel threatening. “It’s not surprising it feels alien, because we know more about 1066, the Great Fire and steam engines than we know about four centuries of British colonial activity. But just because our education system didn’t really prepare us for this, that doesn’t mean that British history is under attack.” Fowler anticipated some hostility towards her report but was nonetheless “shocked” by the press coverage and the ensuing waves of bile (one online comment below a newspaper article discussed how she should be murdered). What most angers her, however, is the charge that historians were stoking a culture war simply by discussing the evidence-based research that the National Trust exists in part to do. The charity was founded in 1895 by Octavia Hill, a Christian socialist who was evangelical about giving the urban working classes fresh air and green space, working with two like-minded colleagues. “She used to walk children out of London into Epping Forest because she believed that if you gave them God’s nature, it would inject magic into their lives,” says Ivo Dawnay, the trust’s former director for London (and Boris Johnson’s brother-in-law), who tweeted this summer appealing for critics to stop treating it like a political football. “Alongside Hill, there was Hardwicke Rawnsley, a radical vicar in the Lake District who was fighting the railways – your Swampy type. The final one was Robert Hunter, a campaigner for common land.” Funded by wealthy establishment figures, their mission of acquiring land for free public access was nonetheless radical from the start, Dawnay argues: “I’m sure in 1895 there must have been a lot of people thinking it was outrageous.” Their first acquisition was four and a half acres of gorse-covered hillside at Dinas Oleu on the western Welsh coast, donated by a wealthy philanthropist friend of Hill’s named Fanny Talbot in hopes that it would go to “some society that will never vulgarise it, or prevent wild nature having its way”. The stately homes the trust is famous for, however, were a surprisingly late addition. After the first world war, the aristocracy found itself squeezed by high death duties and a dearth of estate workers, many of whom had been killed in the trenches. Historic estates risked being carved up or crumbling into ruins. “The fabric of the landscape was starting to break down,” says Liz Green, the trust’s lead curator in Wales. “You read about this in novels all the time: the young heir comes along, has to flog the family silver off and break apart these great estates.” The solution was the National Trust Act of 1937, allowing estates to be given to the Treasury in lieu of inheritance tax and held by the trust on behalf of the nation in perpetuity. (The trust occupies an unusual position, independent of government but answerable to the nation; technically it doesn’t “own” its assets, but cares for them on Britain’s behalf.) What followed was effectively nationalisation on a scale of which socialists might only dream, albeit in exchange for some hefty tax avoidance, leaving the trust with a new coalition of members: some who joined to walk the land, others interested in “worshipping the aristocracy, or in pictures and furniture and china”, as Dawnay puts it. By the 1960s, that coalition was cracking, with complaints that the trust was becoming a cosy club for the gentry. It was saved by a unifying campaign to rescue the English and Welsh coastline from developers, reflected in the 775 miles of coastal path it owns today, which was so popular that membership soared from about 50,000 in 1960 to a million by 1981. Yet efforts in recent years to broaden the membership have strained that coalition once more. “You go into properties now and it tells you the difference between the Stuarts and the Tudors. The old guard thinks everyone should know the difference, and if they don’t they shouldn’t be there,” Dawnay says. “It’s a small proportion of members, but they have undue influence because they have access to the columnists of the Telegraph and Times and Spectator.” Restore Trust is certainly well-connected for a small protest group, enjoying extensive media coverage for its claims to have attracted thousands of supporters or forced the resignation of the trust’s long-serving chair Tim Parker this summer. (The trust insists Parker’s departure was planned, and that Restore Trust demanded he quit the day after stakeholders were confidentially told he would be leaving.) It is backed by an unusually high-powered team, including PR executive Neil Bennett (an ex-journalist who worked at the Sunday Telegraph under Charles Moore’s editorship) and the millionaire Tory donor Neil Record. Its slickly designed website is currently pumping out information on how National Trust members can vote at the AGM for a change in direction, either in person, online or by post. After a fiery launch, Restore Trust has seemingly tempered its rhetoric. A spokesperson emails that its chief concern is a shift of power from expert curators to managers charged with boosting visitor numbers, leaving properties “peppered inside and out with signage in poor taste and lacking any coherent design, greatly detracting from the aesthetic impact”. Offending examples apparently include signs encouraging children to “pretend to be a bee and waggle along this path”. Worse still, she adds: “There are labels at Stourhead [a Wiltshire stately home], in one of the great libraries of England, on round tables in white gauze – no understanding of the grandeur of the house.” (Museum-style labelling is a surprisingly big bone of contention among members nostalgic for the days when the rooms of country houses were assumed to speak for themselves.) This rather esoteric crusade against dumbing down has, however, been amplified by a cruder rightwing backlash against social justice movements (or what the Common Sense Group calls “cultural Marxism”), plus a post-Brexit push for more “patriotic” history dwelling on past glories, not old wrongs. All three strands of opposition are converging on the AGM. Stephen Green of the virulent rightwing pressure group Christian Voice – perhaps most notorious for speaking in defence of a Ugandan law threatening to impose the death penalty on HIV-positive gay men who had sex – is standing for election to the trust’s governing council on a pitch accusing the trust of becoming “obsessed with LGBT issues” and “woke virtue-signalling”. Green, who is endorsed by Restore Trust, has over the years opposed abortion, the criminalisation of marital rape, compulsory sex education in schools, performances of the musical Jerry Springer: The Opera (which he regarded as blasphemous) and above all the “sinful” practice of homosexuality. He particularly resents the trust’s outing of Robert Wyndham Ketton-Cremer, the owner of Felbrigg Hall in Norfolk until his death in 1969, as gay. “There’s absolutely no evidence that this quite unobtrusive man was some prototype Peter Tatchell, but because he was single and adopted a funny pose outside Felbrigg Hall, he had to be gay,” Green says indignantly. He doesn’t expect to win, he adds, but wants the trust “not to see itself as a vehicle for social change”. Perhaps more typical of grassroots unease is Andrew Powles, chair of Wellingborough civic society, also standing for the council on a platform questioning the trust’s direction. A member for 40 years, he says he was saddened by the bitter divisions evident at last year’s AGM, held virtually due to Covid. “We all logged in and were left feeling: ‘Does it really have to be like this?’ When you see things on the chat box, some people saying, ‘I’m going to resign now’ – they won’t visit, they won’t go to the shop, they won’t have a cup of tea in the cafe, and all that stuff is so crucial.” Powles sees nothing wrong in saying an estate was built on slavery, although he thinks the right place for that information may be the website: “It shouldn’t necessarily spoil the enjoyment of the house.” The Tory MP and former Foreign Office minister Andrew Murrison, who led a parliamentary debate on the trust last autumn, predicts “a great groundswell of members’ opinion” coming to a head at the AGM. A former naval surgeon whose Wiltshire constituency includes Stourhead – named in the colonialism and slavery report because its 18th-century owner inherited money made partly from trading shares in the South Sea company, which supplied slave labour to central and southern America – Murrison regards the report as historically poor, underplaying Britain’s role in abolition. “It’s worthwhile just reflecting on where Britain actually was in the 19th century in relationship to slavery and the progress this country was able to achieve. None of that is really of particular interest to those behind this report and I think that’s wrong, wherever you stand politically.” As trust properties have been either in lockdown or limiting visitors due to Covid since March 2020, it’s impossible to be sure how all this has affected visitor numbers – although Marian Gwyn says a 2007 exhibition she staged on Penrhyn’s connections to slavery boosted visitor numbers by 12.5%. There are, she argues, commercial as well as ethical reasons for telling stories new to visitors. Membership fell from a pre-pandemic peak of nearly 6 million to 5.4 million by this spring, but began rising again as lockdown restrictions lifted. The trust’s director of communications, Celia Richardson, says the numbers closely track whether properties were open to visitors or not (most members are recruited on a visit). The rate of existing members renewing their subscriptions fell by only 1%, while small donations trebled. “What characterises some of this culture war campaign is campaigners completely exaggerating the effect they’re having. We’re recruiting members at the moment every 25 seconds,” says Richardson, who suspects most trust members aren’t enormously interested in the row. “People don’t join a conservation organisation to argue about political theory.” Yet the attacks on an institution she calls “about as Marxist as a cream tea” take their toll. “When there’s a mainstream media story, we will see quite a lot of abuse starting to hit us via social media, via our call centres, direct threats coming into the director general’s inbox. There are culture warriors out there looking for these stories,” Richardson says. Recently she filed a formal complaint with the Spectator over a Charles Moore piece that quoted an employee who allegedly claimed that “at interviews people are asked how they voted in the Brexit referendum, and rejected out of hand if they voted to leave”. (The Spectator’s editor, Fraser Nelson, declined to comment for this article beyond noting that: “Charles is a pretty well established journalist and biographer with a track record that speaks for itself.”) Some of the social media abuse seems to come from bots or from overseas, Richardson says. But she worries about the chilling effect on other charities and cultural institutions, anxious to avoid similar attacks. At her lowest point, Hilary McGrady admits she considered leaving. “There were lots of days when I thought, ‘Why am I putting myself through this? Would it be better for the trust, would it make life easier if I was to go?’” Yet she has, she says, emerged more convinced than ever that the charity should hold true to its beliefs and purpose. Work on slavery and colonialism will continue, but it’s only a “tiny part” of what the trust actually does.  The single biggest issue preoccupying her is the trust’s role, as a major landowner across England, Wales and Northern Ireland, in tackling the climate crisis. “We need to be active on our land, working to try to save nature – this is really important right now, just as the survival of the country house was the thing to focus on in the postwar period.” Once again, that means moving with changing times. From the top of Holly Purdey’s Exmoor farm, you can see right across the valley – a lush patchwork of forest, moor and meadow, beneath a cornflower-blue sky. But Ben Eardley, riverlands project manager here on the vast trust-owned estate at Holnicote, isn’t here to show off the view. We are, instead, gathered expectantly around a cowpat. “Look at the holes!” Eardley says, pointing at the dung. And soon, a tiny black beetle crawls out. You rarely see holes on cowpats now, he explains, because they’re made by dung beetles to whom cattle-worming drugs can be lethal, even once excreted. But Purdey is a rewilding enthusiast, seeking to take her land back to a more natural state, and her cows aren’t chemically wormed. That makes their dung safe for the beetles, who in return break it down, fertilising the soil and improving the grass for the cows. “That cowpat is an amazing habitat. It’s not as exciting as a wildflower, but it’s really important,” Eardley says. When 33-year-old Purdey took over the tenancy of this trust-owned farm three years ago, she planted trees, rested exhausted pastures and used water management techniques to stop heavy rains from washing away topsoil. Now she calculates that her sheep, goat, cattle and chicken farm is finally carbon neutral, absorbing more carbon than it emits. Purdey, who grew up on an organic farm on Exmoor, admits her methods initially met with some local scepticism. But she’s determined to prove the changes can be economically viable, while reducing carbon emissions and building resilience to extreme weather. “Me and my husband just feel that we’ve got to bring about change, and if that means going against the status quo, then we’ve got to make that stand and showcase how we can do it while still producing food,” she says. Further down the valley, the trust has reintroduced the first pair of beavers to roam this land in hundreds of years. Yogi and Grylls have dammed the shallow streams flowing through their enclosure, creating a lake that teemed with tadpoles in spring and which Eardley hopes will create rich new wildlife habitats. The beavers (and now their newborn kit Rashford) complement a river management system aiming to get water spilling up over the land where it’s safe to do so, reducing the flood risk downstream while creating a carbon-sequestering wetland home to dragonflies, birds, bats and insects. Here, at least, the trust shares common ground with the government. The environment minister, Zac Goldsmith, is a rewilding enthusiast and Boris Johnson unexpectedly pledged in this month’s party conference speech to “build back beaver” in British rivers. Reducing carbon emissions from farming, meanwhile, could help Britain meet its net zero targets. Yet McGrady insists this focus on the land doesn’t mean neglecting the houses; if anything, she sees exhuming their hidden histories as a means of revival. “Time and time again I’ve spoken to visitors who said, ‘I love this place, I haven’t been in the house for quite a long time because nothing has changed, but I love the garden.’ Actually what I want is to get more people back into the houses to really learn a bit more, so that every time they come there will be something different that will shine a light on a new bit of the collection.” In hindsight, McGrady admits she wouldn’t have published the colonialism and slavery report while she was still busy managing the consequences of Covid, leaving little time to prepare stakeholders for what was coming. But she doesn’t regret the work itself, rejecting suggestions that it was released under pressure from social justice campaigners. “I never did this piece of work to appease one community or annoy another. I genuinely did it because I think it’s a fascinating story – it adds more interest, more complexity, a depth of history that we haven’t told before. Why is that not a good thing?” What if it exposes the trust to demands for reparations, or repatriating colonial treasures currently in its collections? The shape of a fledgling British reparations movement is still emerging, although so far it has emphasised acknowledging and atoning for past injustices as much as money. McGrady can’t yet say what it might mean for the trust, suggesting it would follow a national policy lead: “We would be absolutely falling in behind the people who are responsible for that, like the Arts Council or English Heritage.” But relations with donor families remain a delicate subject. The two surviving Pennant heirs – one of whom still lives in north Wales, while the other is a poet living between the UK and Cyprus – have donated to charities in Jamaica, but a source with knowledge of the family says they have faced criticism over its past actions. “I know several families who have connections to slavery and have the same sort of paperwork the Pennants have, and no way will they share it because they’ve seen what’s happened.” McGrady’s Northern Irish upbringing has helped convince her that openness is crucial to reconciling conflict. “I understand the complexities of history and different people’s perspective on history and why these are sensitive,” she says. “But my attitude, partly because I come from Northern Ireland, is that I think we need to talk about it.” Over summer, there have been signs of the culture wars cooling. Oliver Dowden visited the trust-owned Giant’s Causeway in Northern Ireland and publicly praised its work there; ministers pointedly defended the RNLI after Nigel Farage criticised it for rescuing drowning refugees from the Channel. Does McGrady sense a change in the political weather? “I’d certainly like to think the nation’s being a bit kinder to itself,” she says, noting the way England rallied behind its football team this summer despite initial protests over players taking the knee. “What the England team did was bring a huge sense of celebration and pride to the nation. I thought it was amazing, and to undercut it with all this sort of nastiness was just such an own goal. I think the nation did realise: we’ve got something here that’s really valuable – why are we giving it a hard time? In a way I think that’s a little bit similar with the National Trust.” With a potentially turbulent AGM approaching, she professes herself “hopeful but not complacent”; the lesson she has drawn from the past year is that conflict is unlikely to go away, but that leaders can become more resilient in the face of attack. A few days later, the charity’s official Twitter account posts a soothing picture of late-flowering roses and lavender, with the caption: “A stroll through a well-appointed garden is where you can find your calm.” But only, perhaps, after the storm. \n",
      "US health officials are setting the stage for a national Covid-19 vaccination campaign for younger children, inviting state officials to order doses before the shots are authorized. Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine is currently being given to people as young as 12 in the US. Over the next three weeks, federal officials plan to discuss making smaller-dose versions available to the nation’s 28 million children between the ages of five and 11. That would end a 10-month wait for many families who are anxiously awaiting the approval of vaccines for younger children. To help states and cities prepare, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) this week sent out a seven-page document with guidance on how to set up expanded vaccination programs. It notes pharmacies in every state can give Covid-19 shots to children, but that only doses prepared and packaged specifically for children are to be used for those under 12. It doesn’t speak to some thornier questions, however, such as how much school-based clinics should be relied on or whether kids should be required to get then shots as a condition of school attendance. Those questions will have to be worked out in each state and city. The guidance comes as communities are gearing up for a new phase in the campaign to vaccinate as many people as possible against a virus that has killed more than 720,000 in the US. The disease has been most dangerous to older adults, who have higher rates of death and hospitalization than children. But some kids are at risk for severe illness, and more than 540 US children have died from Covid-19, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). Just as important, health officials believe vaccinating children will reduce virus spread to vulnerable adults. Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech are furthest along in researching use of their vaccine in younger children. They say a two-dose vaccine series one-third as potent as the version giving to people over 12 years old is safe and effective in five- to 11-year-olds. An independent expert panel of experts who advise the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is scheduled to debate the the safety and efficacy of the vaccines at a meeting in late October. Their recommendation will guide whether the FDA decides to allow the vaccines for children to be used on an emergency basis. The FDA usually takes the advice of its expert panels. If the FDA authorizes the kid-size doses, a different expert panel of independent experts who advise the CDC will debate clinical questions in early November, and then offer a recommendation to the CDC. It’s not yet clear how many people will get shots for their younger kids right away, said Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. “We’re going to have potentially a very busy, and perhaps modestly chaotic time” initially, he said. But there probably will not be the kind of heavy demand seen when shots first became available for adults, he added. Polls suggest about one-third of parents whose children are in this age group said they would get their child vaccinated “right away,” according to a Kaiser Family Foundation tracking poll. Authorities may then face vaccine hesitant parents, some of whom may not be vaccinated themselves. Further, the approval of vaccines for young children could open a new debate on whether schools should mandate vaccines for young children. Some major school districts, such as in Los Angeles, have already done so for kids older than 12. Nearly 77% of people older than 12 are vaccinated in the US, according to the CDC. Comparatively, 95.5% of people in the highest risk age group, those older than 65, are vaccinated. New CDC guidance calls for shots to be given at the offices of pediatricians and family-practice doctors, and at pharmacies, rural health clinics and federally-qualified health centers. The CDC discussed the option of vaccination clinics at schools, but stopped short of endorsing that as a primary way to get kids vaccinated. School clinics are logistically appealing, but many parents may not be comfortable with the idea, Plescia said. The guidance also warns health care providers to only use doses that have been prepared especially for kids, and not try to fraction adult doses, Plescia noted. CDC guidance said immunization program managers can start ordering doses Wednesday, though vials wouldn’t be delivered until the FDA and CDC sign off. The plan to vaccinate young children from Covid-19 is distinct from the initial vaccine roll-out, which initially focused on sending vaccines to hospitals and pharmacies.Consequently, some office-based physicians felt left out. Dr Jesse Hackell registered early with New York state to be able to administer the shots to teens. He said his office, located 25 miles north of New York City, didn’t receive doses for that until May. But Hackell said the CDC has reassured pediatricians that once authorization happens for 5- to-11-year-olds, the process will go more smoothly and pediatricians’ offices will be able to get shipments quickly. Dr Richard Besser called on the government to do more to address racial and economic disparities that might emerge in the push to vaccinate younger kids.For example, kids may not get shots if parents can’t get time off from work to bring them in. “It’s really important that we recognize the barriers to vaccinations,” said Besser, chief executive of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and former acting director of the CDC.AP medical writer Lindsey Tanner contributed to this report from Three Oaks, Michigan\n",

      "New Zealand’s “Super Saturday” of Covid vaccinations has proved a hit, with more than 2.5% of the population responding to the call to get jabbed on a single day. The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, set an ambitious goal of administering 100,000 shots on the day, aiming to push vaccination rates towards her 90% goal. But New Zealanders turned out in even greater numbers. As of 7pm local time (0700 BST), health workers had administered 127,342 Pfizer doses on Saturday, jabbing at a higher per capita rate than any day of the rollouts in Australia, the UK, US or Canada. The director general of health, Ashley Bloomfield, could not hide his exultation as vaccine rates pushed past the 100,000 mark. “Already there and more to come. Let’s do this. Fantastic effort. Go whanau [family],” he said. Ardern broke the news at 3pm, live on air during a special telethon – called the vaxathon – as part of the Super Saturday efforts. “Go big or go home,” she said, calling on New Zealanders to push closer to 150,000 jabs. “The team of 5 million have turned out in record numbers to protect whanau and loved ones,” she added. “Super Saturday has exceeded expectations and has ensured as a country we are more protected from Covid-19. “Keeping up this momentum over the coming weeks means we could become among the most vaccinated countries in the world, ensuring we are protected from the virus and can get back to the things we love.” The vaxathon called upon a who’s who of New Zealand talent. The film director Taika Waititi, the singers Lorde and Marlon Williams, as well as rugby’s All Blacks and netball’s Silver Ferns all joined the eight-hour broadcast. Ardern’s fiance, Clarke Gayford, was on DJ duty, celebrating breaking the 100,000 barrier with a record scratch. The vaxathon crossed live to events across the country, including festivals for Tongan, Samoan, Māori and other populations. According to the Ministry of Health, about 5% of the Tongan community in New Zealand were vaccinated on Super Saturday. Air New Zealand opened one of its Boeing 787s to allow a lucky few to be vaccinated in business class, before eating in-flight snacks while waiting out their observation period. Others were given free KFC, pizzas or vouchers for rolling up their sleeves. The effort leaves New Zealand with roughly 83% vaccination coverage (of people aged 12 and over). Health officials reported 41 community cases on Saturday, down from 55, 71 and 65 in the past three days. All but one of the new cases were in Auckland, the centre of the Delta outbreak that has led to 60 consecutive days of lockdow. The other case is in Waikato, and is a household contact of a previous case and the person is already in quarantine. The government predicted this week case numbers would reach about 140 a day by the end of the month. Wastewater samples have revealed Covid in Beachlands and Pukekohe in outer Auckland, Wellsford in Northland, and previously in Waikato’s Te Awamutu, suggesting the outbreak is not yet controlled. There are 31 New Zealanders in hospital with the virus, with six in intensive care.\n",

      "Russia reported 1,002 deaths from the coronavirus on Saturday, the first time the country’s daily number has passed the 1,000 mark since the start of the pandemic. New Covid-19 cases confirmed in the previous 24 hours numbered 33,208, setting a record for the fifth consecutive day, the Russian coronavirus taskforce said. Russian authorities have blamed a slow vaccination campaign for the sharp rise of infections and deaths. The surge in numbers prompted the health ministry this week to ask retired medics who have been vaccinated to return to hospitals. Data published by the coronavirus taskforce on Saturday shows that an estimated 45% of the country’s population may have an immunity to Covid-19 after receiving a vaccine or recovering from the illness. In Moscow, the figure is 61% and is at 64% in the region surrounding the capital. Russia was quick to develop and launch its Sputnik V vaccine when the coronavirus pandemic struck last year, but take-up has been slow, with many Russians citing distrust of the authorities and fear of new medical products. Only about 48 million out of Russia’s population of 144 million are fully vaccinated, according to the latest data from the coronavirus taskforce, with 51 million having received one shot. The latest figures brought Russia’s total official death toll to 222,315, with a total of 7,958,384 cases. The Rosstat statistic service, which keeps a separate count of coronavirus deaths, said this month that about 418,000 deaths were recorded between April 2020 and August 2021. The excess mortality in Russia, which some epidemiologists say is the best way to measure the impact of a pandemic, reached 575,000 additional deaths in the same period in comparison with the average mortality rate in 2015-2019. \n",

      "Projected sea level rise would mean 40% of the buildings in the Marshall Islands’ capital of Majuro would be permanently flooded and entire islands would disappear, potentially costing the Pacific country its status as a nation, according to a devastating new report from the World Bank. The report, Mapping the Marshall Islands, containing grim visualisations of the impact of sea level rise on the Marshall Islands, has been two years in the making and was shared exclusively with the Guardian ahead of its release in coming weeks. The Marshall Islands is a country in the north Pacific, halfway between Hawaii and Australia. It has a population of 59,000 and a land mass of just 180sq km, consisting of 1,156 individual islands. It is one of the countries considered most at risk of disappearing due to sea level rise. Artessa Saldivar-Sali, the World Bank disaster risk management specialist who led the work on the report, said the modelling shows the Marshall Islands could lose significant and crucial parts of its land and infrastructure. “With a 1-metre sea level rise, we project that about 40% of buildings in the capital, Majuro, would be permanently inundated, permanently flooded. So that is a quite big impact,” she said. In addition to every two in five buildings being permanently flooded, up to 96% of the city, with a population of 20,000, would face frequent flooding. “It’s always been a dark future, but now that dark future is becoming more clear,” said Kathy Jetñil-Kijiner, a poet and climate envoy from the Marshall Islands. “I remember first reading the report and thinking, ‘Oh, that’s what it’s going to look like, that’s what it’s going to cause’, and none of it feels good. I can say definitively that it’s a really difficult report to get through.” Jetñil-Kijiner said she was shocked to learn that her island would be so badly affected. “One of the islands listed as being 100% underwater, completely covered, is Jaluit, which is actually the island where my family comes from,” she said. “It’s the land that my daughter is named after. So, when I saw that, I had to tell my family that this is about to happen, they needed to be aware of this. It really hit hard.” The modelling done for the report is unique, in that it combines sea level rise and flood scenarios with the geography of exposure to the population, assets, buildings and other infrastructure to better determine the actual impacts. Its visualisation tool shows a building-by-building breakdown of what various sea level rises would mean for the atoll nation. Saldivar-Sali said by being so specific with the modelling, they can better assess the broader impacts. “It amounts to coastal erosion, more houses falling into the sea, significant land loss, and saltwater intruding on freshwater sources, which obviously has a really big impact on agriculture and on the availability of water supply,” she said. “With this level of inundation, for daily life to continue, some serious adaptation measures would be necessary, such as raising floor levels, raising land levels or relocating buildings inland. All these options come with a cost, however. With the detail provided in the study, schools, businesses and housing developers could see where low-cost options (such as moving a building site a few feet) will have longer-term benefits in adapting to and dealing with sea level rise.” On top of the effects on individual livelihoods and the environment, the loss of land also presents a legal issue for the Marshall Islands. “A key issue is the way that international law draws the difference between an island and just a rock, is whether this piece of territory is capable of sustaining human and economic life of its own,” said Duygu Çiçek, the author of the Legal Dimensions of Sea Level Rise, who advised the World Bank on the report. “Under international law, statehood is established on the presumption that they will continue to be a state, with stability, a defined territory and population. So, the question remains of whether the Marshall Islands’ territorial elements being challenged by sea level rise would lead to any impairment of statehood,” she said. Another legal concern for the Marshall Islands brought on by sea level rise is that of losing its vast exclusive maritime zone and therefore access to crucial fisheries that provide much of the country’s food and contributes significantly to its GDP. This is something Pacific island nations, including the Marshall Islands, are well aware of and have begun taking action on. In a declaration published by the Pacific Islands Forum in August, Pacific leaders committed to fixing the baselines of maritime zones, so that in the event of islands shrinking or disappearing, nations retained the same amount of ocean territory. Saldivar-Sali said the new report, while highlighting a bleak future, should empower decision-makers and communities to understand their options. “This could include things like raising land, reclaiming land, or even consolidating population within an island. For the people of the Marshall Islands, international migration is the option of last resort,” she said.\n",
      "Consistency is so last decade, don’t you think? And mea culpas? Never met them. In the last eight years of Coalition rule, there have been more than 20 different climate and energy policies, which have been announced with fanfare before fizzing into the background, or just being trashed altogether. Here’s a short rundown of what the last eight years has looked like. After Tony Abbott repealed Labor’s carbon price, his new government replaces the measures with the Direct Action policy. It is described as “a scheme that will provide the incentive for firms to reduce their carbon emissions and, at the same time, minimise the costs to industry and the Australian economy”. The emissions reduction fund is a key component, set up to “directly support CO2 emissions reduction activities by business and industry”. The original idea behind the ERF is that the government will pay for projects that will reduce CO2 emissions “at least cost”. Its adequacy and impact are questioned from the beginning and it has limited real-world impact. Scott Morrison brings in a lump of coal to parliament and coos, “This is coal. Do not be afraid. Do not be scared. It will not hurt you,” before passing it around the frontbench where it is cradled by Barnaby Joyce. At the same time, the Turnbull government insists it is taking climate policy seriously. Malcolm Turnbull embarks on designing a new energy policy to improve system reliability while reducing emissions in electricity. The chief scientist, Alan Finkel, suggests the government adopt a clean energy target. That proposal lasts about five minutes. The rejection of the clean energy target leads to the national energy guarantee, which signals the end of Turnbull’s prime ministership. First mentioned in late 2017, the Neg imposes two obligations on energy retailers: to supply sufficient quantities of “reliable” power to the market, and to reduce emissions between 2020 and 2030. Turnbull wants to legislate the mechanism but the proposal becomes enmeshed in leadership tensions. With rightwingers moving against him, he proposes implementing elements of the Neg through regulation rather than legislation. When Morrison takes over as prime minister, he dumps the Neg’s emissions reduction component altogether. In 2013 Abbott tried to move against the renewable energy target as well as Labor’s carbon price. This failed but the scheme was criticised by the Coalition for bringing too much intermittent renewable energy into the power grid. Five years later, with the RET due to expire in 2020, the minister for emissions reduction, Angus Taylor, says there will be no policy to replace it. “The truth of the matter is the renewable energy target is going to wind down from 2020, it reaches its peak in 2020, and we won’t be replacing that with anything,” he says. That contradicts advice from the energy security board, which says investors and the market need policy certainty to ensure orderly investment. With new climate policy in the too-hard basket, the Coalition focuses on energy prices. At this point, the Morrison government is still not ruling out investing in further coal stations. The “big stick” policies are designed to give the government powers to break up energy companies if consumer prices don’t fall. In the end, the government backs down from its threat of divesture powers, and the stick becomes more of a twig amid internal and external discord at the idea. The divesture powers go from complete ministerial discretion, to Australian Competition and Consumer Commission advice and ministerial discretion, to no divesture powers. A default market offer for energy prices is also introduced, which forces power companies to lower their opening offers to customers, and make it easier for consumers to find cheaper electricity plans. All of this is geared towards the coming 2019 election, which the Coalition wins. Facing a possible blow-up from the Nationals, Taylor floats the idea that taxpayers indemnify new coal projects against any sort of carbon price. “What we are saying is the risks that government needs to absorb to get investment in reliable generation, we will look at absorbing,” he says. “We need the investment.”  Power companies are moving away from coal as generation assets age, and firmed renewables lower in price. But the Nationals want to prolong coal generation. A standoff with private power companies heats up over the future of their ageing coal assets. The Nationals propose taxpayer underwriting of new coal generation. But that proves a red line for Liberals in metropolitan seats. There are internal tensions about carbon risk and banks refusing to finance new coal projects. The Nationals go to war with the banks, accusing them of virtue signalling. But Liberals argue banks are acting prudently. In yet another attempt to quell rumblings within the National party, some suggest nuclear power is a potential answer to everyone’s problems. A parliamentary inquiry is established to look into an Australian nuclear power industry, which government MPs support and non-government MPs do not. Australia has a moratorium on nuclear energy for one thing, for another, there is no guarantee of a commercial return, given the cost. And that’s even with a carbon price, which the Morrison government is against. Nuclear power is not carbon neutral and it is not a renewable energy (uranium is finite). Still, the nuclear debate continues. Now with News Corp advocacy. In a press conference before his address to the UN in New York, Morrison says his government’s record on climate has been “misrepresented” by the media. Asked whether Australia intends to update its emissions reduction commitments as required by the Paris agreement’s five-yearly review process, he suggests that Australia’s 2030 target is fixed: “We are keeping to the commitments we have set and do you know why? That’s what I put to the Australian people.” Turns out that not having a stable climate policy is not great when it comes to investment. So the government turns to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and offers up $1bn “to support Government investment in new energy generation, storage and transmission infrastructure, including eligible projects shortlisted under the Underwriting New Generation Investments (UNGI) program”. (Not the coal ones though.) The investment is a bit of a turnaround from 2015 when Abbott tried to abolish the fund, and then, when the Senate wouldn’t let him, banned it from investing in major wind and solar projects. Of course, this is still Australia, so the clean energy fund and the Australian renewable energy agency find their mandates changed so they can be used to finance and support fossil fuel projects, as long as there is some (so far failed) carbon abatement project attached. “There are no good and bad emissions reductions,” Morrison says. There are only emissions reductions. Emissions reductions by different means have no greater or lesser moral qualities.” This is mainly done because of the “gas-led recovery” the government decides is going to lead Australia out of Covid. Gas is, of course, a fossil fuel. The gas-fired recovery is the brain child of the Covid advisory recovery committee headed by Nev Power, a former mining executive. The last couple of years have all been about roadmaps and shifting horizons, so it makes sense that a technology roadmap is created to shape Australia’s climate policy. The main takeaway? “Technology not taxes”. Which ignores the fact that no one is proposing a tax, because this is not 2010 and the world has moved on.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change drops its latest report, which finds we are almost out of time to act in any sort of meaningful way on the climate crisis. Which increases pressure on Australia from its key allies and trading partners – the US, Europe and the UK, to commit to doing something. So far, what Australia has floated is deemed insufficient. An actual plan is now apparently forthcoming but first it has to get past the Nationals. There is a meeting on Sunday to discuss the plan, which is meant to finally commit Australia to a net zero emissions target by 2050. Just no one mention 2030. After first saying his job was to stay and speak to Australians about the plan, not the international community, Morrison confirms he will attend the UN climate summit next month, where he will present Australia’s climate plan to the world. It is worth keeping in mind that the government is focused on all things 2050, while the world is moving to medium-term targets for 2030. That debate is still very much not settled in Australia. It’s also worth keeping in mind that net zero emissions does not mean no emissions.\n",
      "When he was a little boy in the 1980s, Wang Xiaojun was taught to be proud of his home town of Lüliang in the north-western Chinese province of Shanxi. Shanxi is China’s biggest coal-producing region, and Lüliang was a significant base for the army during the second world war. Nestled in the mountains of the dusty Loess Plateau, Lüliang, a city of 3.4 million people, has had less to shout about in recent years. A series of corruption scandals in the city brought down several high profile officials shortly after President Xi Jinping came to power in 2013; there are concerns over the high number of babies born with congenital defects, blamed by experts on air pollution; and, last week, a huge flood forced coal mines to close just as China scrambles to tackle its energy crunch. Coal is the main source of power generation in China, but Xi has vowed to change that. The country has been the world’s biggest producer of greenhouse gas emissions for more than a decade now. A year ago, Xi pledged his country’s carbon emissions would peak by 2030, then achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. Last month, he announced China would stop building new coal-fired projects overseas in a move that analysts say could be pivotal in tackling global emissions. Ending a dependency on coal at home has proved trickier. Shortly after he took office, Xi began to plan on low-carbon and sustainable development of “resource-based cities”. But since September China has been experiencing its own coal dilemma, with power shortages spread across key regions, causing a ripple effect to the global economy. To tackle the crisis, officials ordered more than 70 mines in Inner Mongolia to increase coal production by almost 100m tonnes early this month. And on 29 September Shanxi promised to supply coal to 14 other regions across China to ensure sufficient energy throughout this winter.  Outside China, there is a fear that Beijing may be rethinking its promises on decarbonisation. That mood darkened last week, when it emerged that Xi would not be attending Cop26 in person. It is a worry that some veteran China analysts dismiss as over-interpretation – Xi has not left the country since January 2020 and was always unlikely to make an exception for Cop26, particularly as it is being hosted by a western nation. They argue that Beijing’s recent whac-a-mole approach merely reflects the messy reality of the country’s energy transition. To residents in Shanxi, however, China’s reliance on dirty coal is a vicious circle that the province of 37 million people can not easily pull itself out of, despite the promises from central government. “It is not about whether China can be less reliant on coal eventually, it is rather about what will happen to a province like ours afterwards,” Wang, who now works as a climate campaigner, told the Observer. “As an activist, of course I’d like to see my home town move away from coal. After all, I grew up only knowing the sky is grey and coal is the only source of energy. But I also worry what will happen to a province whose economy overwhelmingly depends on coal and heavy industries, and the millions of people whose livelihoods are reliant on them.” In Lüliang, villages like Wang’s are often built atop barren mountains to avoid constant floods. Until the 1980s, most of the boys would grow up to become farmers. Then coal became a valuable commodity as China began to expand its economy. But a few years ago, as coal depleted underneath some mountains, many villages collapsed and people died. Those who survived moved away. In Wang’s old village, only three elderly people are still there, he said. “They are reluctant to move. It’s where they spent most of their lives.” Growing up with coal miners in the village, Wang saw with his own eyes how dangerous mines could be. Seven years ago, when working in a coal mine, Wang’s 38-year-old cousin, Wang Xiaobing, was caught in an accident. A ceiling collapsed and he lost his lower left leg. He was sent home after the incident. But, with a young family to support and lacking the skills to switch career, Xiaobing eventually went back to his former mine as a driver. Shortly after, he developed lung and liver illness and died two years ago. “You see, the addiction to coal is not just on a national level, but also on a personal level. It’s not easy to move away from,” Wang said. “A lot of people here, including another relative of mine, are unhappy with [media] talk of climate change and the [the government’s] effort to reduce coal consumption. To us, this is bread and butter. Without it, what would Lüliang look like?” “They need to start to prepare for a coal-free future right now before it’s too late.” Stories like this have been commonplace across China’s coal regions in the past two decades. In the decade between 2000 and 2010, on average 4,870 people died in mine accidents every year. In the US, the figure was only 33. The figure began to decrease dramatically in the last decade as the government imposed strict safety rules for mine owners and nationalised many mines. Han Jinsong (not his real name), a 50-year-old former coal miner in the city of Fengyang, said that while also working as a miner, his elder brother was hit by a mine car and stayed in hospital for about six months. “He became disabled and the coal mine he worked at compensated for once,” he said. “That’s it.” Han added: “Despite all these tragedies, it’s unrealistic for China to move away from coal. You’ve seen the recent power shortages spread across the country. Now the government has to reopen coal mines to meet the accelerating demand. It’s always going to be a dilemma.” It’s a reality that senior officials have openly admitted. “China’s energy structure is dominated by coal power. This is an objective reality,” said Su Wei, deputy secretary-general of the National Development and Reform Commission in Beijing, in April. “We have no other choice. For a period of time, we may need to use coal power as a point of flexible adjustment.” “The rise and fall of Lüliang – as well as other coal-heavy cities – is also the story of China’s changing economic and social structure,” said Judith Audin, a French sociologist who writes about the coal industry in Shanxi province. In 2010, when “Shanxi coal boss” – a term used as a symbol of Dickensian China – often appeared in social media, Lüliang’s GDP growth was at a staggering 21%. In 2020, it was only 2.7%. Local officials have been talking about transition for a long time. When Lüliang’s economy was booming a decade ago, billions were poured into road construction and apartment buildings. But by 2015, supply had far exceeded the demand. Coupled with a decrease in coal consumption, the local economy crashed, and the mayor was sacked on corruption charges. “Across Shanxi, there have been other experiments in recent years, too,” said Audin. In Datong, China’s “coal capital”, the coal mining land is now covered in solar panels and wind turbines. “But even if these efforts were eventually successful, to what extent will these new energy businesses absorb the excess labour left by coal mining?” Audin said. “And how would the authorities deal with the generations of coal miners and their families who’ve helped power China but who have no other skills in the new economy?”\n",
      "A series of commissioned murals in Cardiff city centre was mistakenly washed away by cleaning staff after a “devastating” miscommunication.

They were painted by three young female artists involved in the PWSH project, including Turner Prize nominee Beth Blandford. PWSH’s stated aim is to “enable Cardiff-born and based emerging and established visual artists to decorate their city centre with artwork that celebrates and represents a breadth of local talent”. “We are absolutely devastated that our artwork at the back of the old Debenhams was removed yesterday,” PSWH said in an Instagram post on Friday. “We are not sure why or how this has happened, but we’re trying to get to the bottom of it and we will keep you all updated when we know more. Apparently, there has been some sort of city centre cleaning team ‘miscommunication’. That area is now a soul-less mess again,” the statement added. In a public apology to PWSH, For Cardiff called the incident “a devastating error” and promised it would try to rectify the situation. “We offer our sincere and heartfelt apology to the talented artists, Beth Blandford, Amber Forde and Temeka Davies who took the opportunity to brighten up Cardiff and contribute to its vibrant and exciting culture through their artworks … We’re working with the creative director of the project as to how we can best rectify this situation as quickly as possible.”\n",

      "A soldier has died during an army training exercise at a military facility in Wiltshire, the Ministry of Defence has confirmed. Wiltshire Today reported the soldier sustained significant injuries after a tank rolled over during a military exercise. The Guardian has not been able to independently verify these claims. “It is with sadness that we can confirm the death of a soldier on Salisbury Plain training area. Wiltshire police are investigating and therefore it would be inappropriate to comment further,” an army spokesperson said. Dorset and Wiltshire fire and rescue service said it arrived at the scene at 11.57am on Friday with two fire engines and a heavy rescue unit, in response to a road traffic collision. Wiltshire police and the MoD also attended the scene, along with a hazardous area response Team, comprised of specialist paramedics trained to deal with serious accidents, according to Wiltshire Today. There have been 150 deaths of UK armed forces members in military exercises from January 2000 to August 2021, according to MoD statistics. Fewer than 6% of all deaths among UK armed forces personnel occur during training. The data includes disease-related deaths, deaths caused by injuries, or where the cause was not yet known.\n",
      "The Oscar-winning film producer and environmentalist David Puttnam has announced his resignation from the House of Lords over concerns the UK government is on a “path to self-inflicted disaster”. Lord Puttnam, a Labour party member, was nominated to the Lords by Tony Blair in 1997 and has served on a number of select committees focusing on broadcast regulation, media plurality and digital communications. In his retirement speech on Friday, Puttnam warned of “multiple dangers” facing British democracy and accused Boris Johnson of running a “populist government that’s trampling on held rights and conventions, with the sole purpose of tightening its grip on power”. Puttnam pointed to the government’s plans to widen the Official Secrets Act, along with its proposed elections bill aimed at making photo ID mandatory at polling stations, as recent examples of creeping authoritarianism. His main concern though centred on the government’s lacklustre response to a report he co-authored as chair of the select committee on democracy and digital technologies in June 2020. In it, the committee warned political power was being “ceded to a few unelected and unaccountable digital corporations” and that a “pandemic of ‘misinformation’ and ‘disinformation’” had taken hold. “If allowed to flourish, these counterfeit truths will result in the collapse of public trust, and without trust democracy as we know it will simply decline into irrelevance,” the report said. The committee offered 45 recommendations for the government to implement that would update electoral law for the online age and create a more digitally literate society. “The ‘resurrection’ of our capacity to trust each other, and the systems through which we receive information – the same information on which we base many of the most important decisions of our lives – is fundamental to our survival …The only accurate way to describe the government’s response to our report is ‘lamentable’,” Puttnam said. A resident of West Cork in Ireland for more than 20 years, Puttnam also pointed to the “pig-ignorance” displayed by MPs during Brexit negotiations towards the Irish border as another reason for his departure from politics, and said he was “embarrassed” by the country Britain had become since leaving the EU. “Mirroring the anxieties of many of those angry Brexiteers in 2016, I feel I’ve had my country of birth, and the values I believed it to represent, stolen from me … I find myself embarrassed by what, on an almost daily basis, I see it becoming – my old enemy Rupert Murdoch’s dream made real. He never liked Britain, and he’s kind of won, he’s helped remake it in his own malevolent image,” he said.\n",

      "Yasir al-Rumayyan, the new non-executive chairman of Newcastle United, was involved in a controversial “anti-corruption” campaign in Saudi Arabia that included the transfer of assets on behalf of the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. Details of Rumayyan’s role – including the transfer of a charter jet company to the Public Investment Fund (PIF), where he serves as governor – are contained in court documents that shed light on his relationship with Prince Mohammed. The inner workings of the PIF have been a source of intense interest after it led a consortium that acquired Newcastle United this month. The state-owned sovereign wealth fund is run by Rumayyan and chaired by the crown prince. The Saudi-led consortium withdrew its bid to acquire Newcastle in 2020 amid concerns that the PIF was part the Saudi state. But the Premier League approved the deal this month and said it had been given “legally binding assurances that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will not control” the club. The Premier League has not disclosed the nature of the assurances. Internal Saudi documents filed to a civil court in Canada as part of an unrelated case show that in 2017 a close aide to Prince Mohammed ordered Rumayyan – who is formally referred to in memos as “his excellency” and the “supervisor” of the PIF – to transfer 20 companies to the sovereign wealth fund as part of the anti-corruption campaign. One of 20 seized companies, the documents show, was a charter jet company that was later alleged to have been used in the Saudi plot to kill Jamal Khashoggi. US intelligence agencies concluded in an intelligence report that was declassified in February that Prince Mohammed approved Khashoggi’s gruesome murder. There is no suggestion that Rumayyan had any involvement in or knowledge of the alleged use of the jets in the operation that killed the Washington Post journalist. The documents suggest, however, that a senior aide to the crown prince was able to order Rumayyan to take actions related to the PIF on Prince Mohammed’s behalf. The PIF declined to comment. A spokesperson for the Saudi embassy in Washington did not return a request for comment. Rumayyan is a former banker who serves as governor of the PIF and chairman of the oil firm Saudi Aramco. He has overseen billions of dollars in investment by the PIF, including in Uber, Facebook, Disney and Citibank. The Harvard Business School-educated executive is reportedly due to attend his first Newcastle match on Sunday in his new role as non-executive chairman of the club. The internal Saudi documents were filed in a Canadian court as part of a civil case that has been brought by Saudi-owned entities against a former senior Saudi intelligence official, Saad Aljabri, a critic of Prince Mohammed who in turn has accused the Saudi government of trying to assassinate him in Canada. The Saudi government has denied the claims. The court records include copies of memos that were sent to his “excellency the supervisor of the Public Investment Fund” by Mohammad al-Sheikh, a senior Saudi adviser to Prince Mohammed. They relate to the infamous anti-corruption campaign led by the crown prince from November 2017, when 400 of Saudi Arabia’s richest individuals – including princes and ministers – were rounded up and held at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh in what was later condemned by witnesses and critics as a purge involving torture, coercion and the expropriation of billions in assets into Saudi coffers. Mohammad al-Sheikh, the close adviser to the crown prince, defended the campaign in a 2018 interview on CBS. “The anti-corruption crackdown was very simple. We had a serious problem with corruption,” he said. “We had to do what we did at the Ritz.” The memos are labelled “top secret, not for circulation and very urgent”. The first memo, sent on 22 December 2017, calls on Rumayyan to “transfer” a number of companies to the PIF’s ownership that were seized as part of the anti-corruption purge. The second memo, dated two days later, repeats the order with greater urgency and tells Rumayyan to “immediately approve the completion of the necessary procedures”. Saudi documents filed to the court show that in response, Rumayyan sent a handwritten and signed memo on 26 December 2017 to an associate ordering him to “do what’s necessary as fast as possible” to comply with the order. Among the 20 companies included on a list to be transferred to the PIF was Sky Prime Aviation Services, a charter jet company based in Riyadh. The name of the charter jet company resurfaced in 2019 in a report by Agnes Callamard, the former UN special rapporteur who investigated the Khashoggi killing. She concluded that the team of Saudi agents who killed the journalist used two jets operated by Sky Prime Aviation to travel to and from Istanbul before the murder in the Saudi consulate on October 2018.  CNN first reported in February 2021 that court documents showed that the two private jets used by the Saudi assassination squad were owned by a company that had previously been seized by Prince Mohammed. But other details from the court documents relating to Rumayyan’s role in PIF’s acquisition of the charter jet firm and other companies have not previously been reported. The PIF declined to respond to a request for comment from Rumayyan and did not respond to a question about the control of Sky Prime Aviation Services. The Saudi embassy in Washington and the Premier League also declined to comment. Rumayyan has in the past described the abrupt manner in which he was selected by the crown prince to lead the PIF as governor in 2015. “I received a call … The crown prince heard of me. I got the call. I thought it was an interview [to lead the PIF], but it was, like: ‘Here is what I want you to do. One, two, three,’” Rumayyan said in a 2020 interview with the Carlyle Group chief executive, David Rubenstein. After Rumayyan initially said he could start the job in three months, the crown prince told him he had “one month, and you will do it”. A week later Prince Mohammed called back and told Rumayyan he was starting “immediately”. “We are all very proud to be Saudis and to participate in the positive changes the country is living and doing right now,” Rumayyan said in the Rubenstein interview.\n",
      "The internationally renowned artist Basil Watson has been chosen to design a permanent national Windrush monument that will be unveiled in Waterloo next year, despite criticism of its location in London. The statue, which is backed by £1m of government funding, will showcase three figures – a man, woman and child – dressed in their “Sunday best” climbing a mountain of suitcases hand-in-hand. The design pays tribute to the dreams, ambition, courage and resilience of the Windrush pioneers who arrived in Britain after the second world war. Watson said he was “humbled and grateful for this great opportunity”, adding he was now “100% focused on the work ahead as I recognise the important significance of this Windrush generation monument”. The communities minister Kemi Badenoch said Watson’s design would celebrate and honour the contribution of the Windrush generation “right at the centre of our nation’s capital” and become “a permanent place of reflection and inspiration for all, reminding us of our shared history and heritage”. But Arthur Torrington, the co-founder of the Windrush Foundation, has raised concerns about the location. He accused the government in 2019 of “treating the Caribbean community like children” by not consulting with key groups. He said the Caribbean men and women who arrived in the UK at Tilbury Docks, Essex, on the Empire Windrush on 22 June 1948 had travelled through Fenchurch Street, London, on their way to Brixton in south London. He called for the monument to be in Windrush Square in Brixton, saying Waterloo station had “nothing to do” with the Windrush arrival in 1948. Torrington said the failure to move the location undermined the work of the foundation, which he said was the key organisation to keep alive the contributions of the Windrush generation. He said: “Locating a Windrush monument at Waterloo station is another government hijack of ‘Windrush’. The monument is an insult to the Caribbean community.” A spokesperson for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said: “London Waterloo station is strongly associated with the stories of many members of the Windrush generation. It stands at a point where thousands of Windrush pioneers first arrived in London before starting new lives across the UK. “The location of the monument was chosen by the Windrush commemoration committee, whose membership includes leaders and influential voices in the Windrush community. “The Windrush monument at London Waterloo station will be a permanent tribute to a generation of those arrivals from the Caribbean to Britain.”  Floella Benjamin, the chair of the Windrush commemoration committee, said: “This Windrush monument represents the past, present and future and I hope it will be the catalyst for other monuments commemorating the extraordinary contribution of the Windrush generation to this country.”\n",
      "Thousands of pro-military protesters have rallied in central Khartoum, vowing not to leave until the government is dissolved in a threat to Sudan’s transition to civilian rule. The protest on Saturday comes as Sudanese politics reels from divisions among the factions steering the rocky transition from two decades of dictatorship under president Omar al-Bashir, who was ousted by the army in April 2019 following weeks of mass protests. Saturday’s protest was organised by a splinter faction of the Forces for Freedom and Change (FFC), a civilian alliance which spearheaded the anti-Bashir protests and became a key plank of the transition. “We need a military government, the current government has failed to bring us justice and equality,” said Abboud Ahmed, a 50-year-old protester. On Saturday evening, demonstrators set up tents outside the presidential palace demanding the dismissal of the government of prime minister Abdalla Hamdok, a former UN economist whose IMF-backed reforms have hit the pockets of many Sudanese. The government’s supporters charged that the protest was orchestrated by sympathisers of the Bashir regime, which was dominated by Islamists and the military. Protesters chanted “one army, one people” and “the army will bring us bread.” “We are marching in a peaceful protest and we want a military government,” said housewife Enaam Mohamed. Abdelnaby Abdelelah, a protester from the eastern state of Kassala, complained that the government has overlooked other states beyond Khartoum. “We want a government that knows about the things going on in the east,” he said. Outside the presidential palace, the protesters chanted: “We will stay put where we are ... we want the dissolution of this government.” Hamdok warned on Friday that the transition was facing its “worst and most dangerous” crisis. The mainstream faction of the FFC said: “The current crisis is not related to dissolution of the government or not. “It is engineered by some parties to overthrow the revolutionary forces ... paving the way for the return of remnants of the previous regime.” Support for the transitional government has waned in recent months in the face of its tough economic reforms, which have included the slashing of fuel subsidies and a managed float of the Sudanese pound. Inflation has skyrocketed, reaching 422% in July, before easing slightly in August and September. Protests have rocked eastern Sudan where demonstrators have blocked trade through the key hub of Port Sudan since September. On 21 September, the government said it thwarted a coup attempt which it blamed on military officers and civilians linked to Bashir’s regime.\n",
      "Joe Biden faces a key test of public standing in a tight and closely watched campaign for governor in Virginia next month. So important has the fight now become in being seen as a bellwether for the 2022 midterm elections, that two ex-presidents are weighing in on the battle. For Biden and the Democrats winning Virginia would hold out the prospect of keeping a grip on congress next year and avoiding being seen as a lame duck administration. For Republicans, a win could pre-sage a major comeback in 2022 and a return to electoral strength of a party still dominated by Donald Trump. The stakes are so high that both Trump and Barack Obama are intervening in the race. Last week, Trump called in to a gathering of Virginia supporters, urging them to vote for the Republican candidate Glenn Youngkin, and calling him “a great gentleman”. Meanwhile, Obama will later this month arrive in the state to boost turnout among Black voters. “The stakes could not be greater,” Democratic candidate Terry McAuliffe said, as he announced Obama’s campaign support on MSNBC last week. The proxies in the contest, McAuliffe, a former governor running for the job he held from 2014-18, and first-time Republican challenger Youngkin, are currently polling relatively closely at 48.5% and 46.4%, according FiveThirtyEight – making the race unpredictable and tight. The men are running to replace the state’s Democratic governor Ralph Northam who has been in the party’s political doghouse since 2019 when it was revealed his 1984 medical school yearbook page contained a photo of one person dressed as a member of the KKK and another in blackface impersonating an African American. The Virginia race comes against a backdrop of bad news for Biden, who has seen his popularity fall in the aftermath of the botched Afghanistan withdrawal and legislative gridlock on the main plans of his domestic agenda and growing uncertainty of post-pandemic economic recovery. His approval rating has sunk from 55% in March to about 44% now. But so, too, does the contest present a test for Trump, who lost Virginia by 10% in 2020, but is increasingly seen to be gauging his hold on the Republican party and its voters ahead of the midterms, which could then swing his decision to run for re-election in 2024. Nor is Trump’s intervention in the race a win-win for Youngkin. The two men are not likely to campaign in person as Youngkin must simultaneously appeal to pro-Trump rural voters, but not telegraph any association so blatantly that he turns off moderate Republican voters in Virginia’s Washington-centric northern suburbs where elections in the state are often decided. Bob Holsworth, a longtime political analyst in the state, told the Washington Post that if Trump were to hold a rally in the state, it would be a “disaster” for Youngkin. “The more he shows up and he more he participates, the worse off it is for Youngkin,” he added. But Trump countered that political wisdom with some of his own: “The only guys that win are the guys that embrace the Maga movement,” Trump said in an interview with conservative talkshow host John Fredericks.  Instead of overtly embracing Trump, Youngkin has campaigned with Texas senator Ted Cruz and with former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley. But he steered clear of an event hosted by Trump strategist Steve Bannon who may face contempt charges on Tuesday for refusing to cooperate with an investigation into the 6 January Capitol riot. Youngkin was also careful to criticize the Bannon event’s use of a flag that had reportedly been flown at the 6 January insurrection. Youngkin’s hands-off, hands-on approach is also designed to not raise the hackles of relatively unengaged democratic support for McAuliffe, who has his own endorsement issues to deal with.  For his part, Virginia’s former governor comes with the baggage of close ties to the Clintons, whose popularity among independents and left-wing Democrats is far from assured. Last month, Hillary Clinton, whose first, failed presidential nomination campaign was co-chaired by McAuliffe sent out a fundraising email. That was followed by a fundraising event hosted by Bill Clinton. But other Democratic heavy-weights are traveling to Virginia to soothe Democratic anxiety and try to propel McAuliffe’s campaign toward the decisive victory they need. Georgia Democratic star Stacey Abrams and Atlanta mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and first lady Jill Biden are also expected in the state’s northern suburbs, while House speaker Nancy Pelosi plans a fundraiser. But Biden himself has and will likely remain absent from Virginia. Mirroring Youngkin’s relationship to Trump, McAuliffe and his aides have expressed fears over associating with Biden. McAuliffe recently described the president as “unpopular” in Virginia. McAuliffe has also indicated that legislative impasse in Washington is damaging to Democrats in the country at large. “Democrats have got to quit talking, and they’ve got to get something done,” McAuliffe told The Washington Post. “You got elected to get things done. We have the House, Senate and White House.” Hanging over Democratic heads are the memories of losing the midterm elections in 2010, a crushing defeat for Obama that was predicted when Democrats lost a Senate seat in Massachusetts while trying to push through a controversial healthcare reform bill. \n",

      "Al Wolf is used to clearing one or two snakes from under houses but recently was called by a woman who said she had seen rattlesnakes scurry under her northern California house and was surprised to find more than 90 rattlesnakes getting ready to hibernate. Wolf, director of Sonoma County Reptile Rescue, said he crawled under the mountainside home in Santa Rosa and found a rattlesnake right away, then another and another. He got out from under the house, grabbed two buckets, put on long, safety gloves, and went back in.  “I kept finding snakes for the next almost four hours,” Wolf said Friday. “I thought, ‘Oh, good, it was a worthwhile call’ but I was happy to get out because it’s not nice, you run into spider webs and dirt and it smells crappy and it’s musty and you’re on your belly and you’re dirty. I mean, it was work.” But the work paid off. He used a 24in (60cm) snake pole to remove 22 adult rattlesnakes and 59 babies when he first visited the home in the Mayacamas Mountains on 2 October. He returned another two times since and collected 11 more snakes.  All the snakes were northern Pacific rattlesnakes, the only venomous snake found in northern California, he said. Wolf, who has been rescuing snakes for 32 years and has been bitten 13 times, said he responds to calls about snakes under homes in 17 counties and has seen dozens of them in one place in the wild but never under a home. He said he releases the rattlesnakes in the wild away from people and sometimes in private land when ranchers request them for pest control. Wolf said there are plans to return to the house again before the end of the month to see if any more snakes arrived. “We know it’s a den site already because of the babies, and the amount of females I found,” he said.\n",
      "Deadly communal violence has broken out in Bangladesh after allegations of the desecration of an Islamic holy book led to dozens of Hindu temples being attacked and police opening fire on a crowd. At least seven people died in the disturbances. The government deployed paramilitary troops to 22 districts after religious tensions and violence broke out in the city of Cumilla on Wednesday, resulting in the deaths of four Muslims after police fired into crowds. On Friday and Saturday, further communal violence erupted in the capital, Dhaka, as well as in the southern town of Begumganj. One Muslim and two Hindus died in these incidents, one from stab wounds. The trouble was sparked by videos and allegations that spread across social media that a Qur’an, the Muslim holy book, had been placed on the knee of a statue of the Hindu god Hanuman, in a shrine set up for the Hindu holy festival of Durga Puja. After the video went viral on Facebook earlier this week, mobs of more than 500 people gathered in Cumilla and neighbouring districts over the alleged blasphemy. About 10 Hindu temples and shrines were attacked and vandalised by the crowds, who threw stones and smashed statues of the Hindu gods. In Cumilla, police shot teargas and fired on the crowds. Dozens were injured, including several police officers. The anti-Hindu violence continued into Friday and Saturday. More than 80 special shrines set up for the Durga Puja festival were attacked, with about 150 Hindus injured and two killed.  On Friday the prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, promised severe action in response. “The incidents in Cumilla are being thoroughly investigated,” said Hasina. “Nobody will be spared. It doesn’t matter which religion they belong to. They will be hunted down and punished.” Md Faridul Haque Khan, the state minister for religious affairs, said the incident involving the Qur’an would be investigated but added that communal harmony should be protected and urged people not to take the law into their own hands. Obaidul Quader, a minister with the ruling Awami League government, visited a Hindu shrine in the aftermath of the violence. He said “fanatic elements” were responsible for the attacks on the Hindu festival, adding that the government would “not let them proceed with their evil design”. The Bangladesh Hindu Unity Council said in a tweet that it “could not publish” what had happened over the past 24 hours, but stated that “the Hindus of Bangladesh saw the real faces of some people. We don’t know what will happen in the future. But the Hindus of Bangladesh will never forget Durga Puja in 2021.” Hindu religious leaders alleged the attacks were part of a conspiracy to attack their community. Hindus make up 10% of the Muslim-majority country. In August, four Hindu temples were attacked in the country’s Khulna district and in March, during a visit by the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, hardline Islamist groups attacked Hindu shrines. The initial trouble prompted outrage in neighbouring Hindu-majority India.  On Thursday, the Indian government spokesperson, Arindam Bagchi, described the incident as “disturbing” and said officials were in communication with the Bangladesh authorities about the attacks.\n",
      "A Nasa spacecraft named Lucy has rocketed into the sky with diamonds on a 12-year quest to explore eight asteroids. Seven of the mysterious space rocks are among swarms of asteroids sharing Jupiter’s orbit, thought to be the pristine leftovers of planetary formation. An Atlas V rocket blasted off before dawn on Saturday, sending Lucy on a roundabout orbital journey spanning nearly 4bn miles (6.3bn km). “I’m just elated,” Nasa’s associate administrator, Robert Cabana, said after liftoff. “This is the coolest darn mission.” Lucy is named after the 3.2m-year-old skeletal remains of a human ancestor found in Ethiopia nearly half a century ago. That discovery got its name from the 1967 Beatles song Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds, prompting Nasa to send the spacecraft soaring with band members’ lyrics and other luminaries’ words of wisdom imprinted on a plaque. The spacecraft also carries a disc made of lab-grown diamonds for one of its science instruments. In a prerecorded video for Nasa, the Beatles drummer, Ringo Starr, paid tribute to his late colleague John Lennon, credited for writing the song. “Lucy is going back in the sky with diamonds. Johnny will love that,” Starr said. “Anyway, if you meet anyone up there, Lucy, give them peace and love from me.” The paleoanthropologist behind the discovery of the Lucy remains, Donald Johanson, said he was filled with wonder about this “intersection of our past, our present and our future”. “That a human ancestor who lived so long ago stimulated a mission which promises to add valuable information about the formation of our solar system is incredibly exciting,” said Johanson, of Arizona State University, who travelled to Cape Canaveral in Florida for the launch. Lucy’s $981m (£715m) mission is the first to aim for Jupiter’s so-called Trojan entourage: thousands – if not millions – of asteroids that share the gas giant’s expansive orbit around the sun. Some of the Trojan asteroids precede Jupiter in its orbit, while others trail it. Despite their orbits, the Trojans are far from the planet and mostly scattered far from each other. So there was essentially zero chance of Lucy getting clobbered by one as it swooped past its targets, said Southwest Research Institute’s Hal Levison, the mission’s principal scientist. Lucy will swoop past Earth next October and again in 2024 to get enough gravitational oomph to make it all the way out to Jupiter’s orbit. On the way there, the spacecraft will zip past asteroid Donaldjohanson between Mars and Jupiter. The aptly named rock will serve as a 2025 warmup act for the science instruments. Drawing power from two huge circular solar wings, Lucy will chase down five asteroids in the leading pack of Trojans in the late 2020s. The spacecraft will then swoop back toward Earth for another gravity assist in 2030 that will swing it back out to the trailing Trojan cluster, where it will zip past the final two targets in 2033. Lucy will pass within 600 miles of each target; the biggest is about 70 miles across. “Are there mountains? Valleys? Pits? Mesas? Who knows? I’m sure we’re going to be surprised,” said Hal Weaver of Johns Hopkins University, who is in charge of Lucy’s black-and-white camera. “But we can hardly wait to see what … images will reveal about these fossils from the formation of the solar system.”\n",
      "A group of rampant hippopotamuses, introduced by the late Colombia drug lord Pablo Escobar to his private zoo, are being sterilized by the country’s wildlife services, after mounting concern that the 80-strong herd presented a potential environmental disaster as an invasive species. The so-called “cocaine hippos”, whose number has more than doubled since 2012, were sterilized after worries have mounted over their environmental impact, including a threat to human safety. The decision to neutralize the herd’s breeding potential comes after a study earlier this year concluded that the animals had become a hazard. The hippos, which were originally introduced to Escobar’s Hacienda Napoles estate, are one of the most enduring legacies of the notorious cocaine trafficker, who was killed by police in 1993. The study, by researchers at Mexican and Colombian universities, had found that the hippos had bred so successfully that they had spread out from their original home, nearly 100 miles east of the city of Medellín, in the Antioquia department, dispersing around the Magdalena river basin and, as such, should be considered a major invasive species. The study, published in the journal Biological Conservation, recommended the herd be culled. But others promoted sterilization, citing animal rights concerns and support for the African interlopers that have become a tourist attraction that local people feel affection for. Enrique Zerda Ordóñez, a biologist at Colombia’s National University, told CNN earlier this year that chemical castration was the only way forward but acknowledged that sterilizing a hippo is no easy task. According to an update this week, Colombian government has so far sterilized 24 using a chemical that makes them infertile. After Escobar’s death, the hippos were left to their own devices at Hacienda Napoles because they proved too difficult to capture and transport. They soon began expanding into the surrounding region. Whether the new drive to curb the herd will be successful is for now unknown, but the hippos appear well-adapted to their new South American home even at a cost to native species. The Biological Conservation study cited research on the negative effect of hippo faeces on oxygen levels in bodies of water, which can affect fish and ultimately humans. The journal also raised concerns about the transmission of diseases from hippos to humans.\n",
      "US transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg, who has been on paternity leave since mid-August with newborn twins, called right-wing attacks on his paternity leave “strange” and from “a side of the aisle that used to claim the mantle of being pro-family”. Buttigieg – who is gay – was the subject of criticism from Fox News host Tucker Carlson on Thursday, who belittled the secretary’s paternity leave while making homophobic comments and criticizing the administration for supply chain woes. “In his case, I guess he just doesn’t understand the concept of bottle feeding let alone the concept of paternity lave,” Buttigieg said about Carlson on MSNBC. “What we have right now is an administration that’s actually pro-family,” said Buttigieg, who adopted newborn twins with his husband Chasten. “I’m blessed to experience that as an employee, being able to have the flexibility to take care of our newborn children, which is by the way, work, it’s joyful work, it’s wonderful work, but it’s definitely work,” Buttigieg added. The comments came after an attack by Carlson on his show. “Pete Buttigieg has been on leave from his job since August after adopting a child,” Tucker Carlson told his Fox News audience on Thursday. “Paternity leave, they call it, trying to figure out how to breastfeed – no word on how that went.” In fact, Fox News provides paternity leave, and Carlson’s colleagues have previously praised the company’s six weeks of paid leave on-air. “They give us six weeks as dads for paternity and I’m taking that six weeks,” Fox & Friends co-host Todd Piro told his viewers in March, according to the left-leaning research center Media Matters for America. “I can’t wait to bond with my little one.” Similarly, Fox host Jesse Watters said he was “pro-paternity” after taking six weeks following the birth of his third child. A transportation spokesperson said Buttigieg has been “ramping up activities” and is expected to “continue to take some time over the coming weeks to support his husband and take care of his new children”, according to Politico. Carlson is one of the most controversial figures in US media with a history of extremist and racist statements that have often angered advertisers but have won him a hardcore fanbase that makes his show consistently one of the most popular on cable news.\n",
      "A top Republican politician in North Carolina is facing a wave of outrage and backlash, including calls for resignation, from elected officials and various human rights groups over his recent discriminatory comments that likened gay and transgender people to “filth”. Lieutenant Governor Mark Robinson, the state’s highest Republican in an executive office position, made the remarks at Asbury Baptist church in Seagrove, North Carolina, in June. Right Wing Watch, a project of the advocacy group People For the American Way, posted the video on social media last week. In the video, Robinson can be heard saying: “There’s no reason anybody anywhere in America should be telling any child about transgenderism, homosexuality, any of that filth … And yes, I called it filth, and if you don’t like that I called it filth, come see me and I’ll explain it to you.” Andrew Bates, a White House deputy press secretary from North Carolina, condemned Robinson’s remarks, saying, “These words are repugnant and offensive. The role of a leader is to bring people together and stand up for the dignity and rights of everyone; not to spread hate and undermine their own office.” In addition to the White House, Democratic lawmakers and numerous rights groups have criticized Robinson, with some demanding his resignation while others request to meet him to discuss his remarks. Jeff Jackson, a Democratic state senator and US Senate candidate urged Robinson to quit, tweeting, “Calling many of your own constituents ‘filth’ means you have no intention of representing them. Our Lt Governor should resign and allow someone who is prepared to do the job to take his place. This wasn’t a dog whistle, folks. This was old school hate.” The Human Rights Campaign, the nation’s largest LGBTQ civil rights organization, released a statement saying: “We are calling on Lieutenant Governor Mark Robinson to resign for his disgraceful, hateful statements … This is not the first time Robinson has shared his discriminatory views, but it should be the last time he gets away with it as an elected leader.” Kaye Vassey, a spokesperson from the LGBT Center of Raleigh echoed the HRC’s sentiments, telling the Guardian, “I’m not going down a path of politics but just absolute human rights and the words that he spoke are dangerous to the LGBTQ community, especially to the youth … and it’s a travesty.” “We did send an open letter saying we would like to set up that meeting and ask for his resignation,” Vassey added, referring to an open letter sent by St John’s Metropolitan Community Church on behalf of various church groups to Robinson. “Your words have caused considerable harm and you have the potential to cost people their lives. The Trevor Projects estimates that at least one LGBTQ youth between the ages of 13-24 attempts suicide every 45 seconds in the US. This number could be reduced by as much as 40% if an adult in these young people’s lives shares unconditional love with them,” the letter obtained by the Guardian read. Alisson Scott, director of impact and innovation at Campaign for Southern Equality, told the Guardian, “When he makes these comments, he somehow … tries to roll with the assumption that there are no LGBTQ students in existence and that we’re all somehow just adults and that’s simply false … For him to say this, it’s dangerous, it’s a weapon.” Robinson, who has since doubled down on his comments, remained defiant, even posting on Facebook that he will not back down nor be silenced. He also said he would continue to fight for the rights of children to receive an education free from sexual concepts that “do not belong in the classroom”. According to Peter Montgomery, a senior fellow at People For the American Way, Robinson’s act of defiance is “a sign that he is counting on rallying up and motivating the right wing base to carry him over the finish line.” “I think that’s his political strategy – to use this kind of rhetoric to portray himself as the victim. He’s happy to hurl himself at others but somehow people criticizing him for making bigoted comments prompts him to make him seem like the victim,” Montgomery told the Guardian. Robinson’s recent comments are only the latest examples of his discrimination against the LGBTQ community. After the 2016 shooting at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, Robinson wrote, “I pray for the souls of all those killed … However, homosexuality is STILL an abominable sin.”  In 2019, Robinson accused parents of having “mentally raped” their transgender children while criticizing gender reassignment surgeries.\n",
      "Eleven students drowned and 10 others were rescued during a school outing for a river cleanup in Indonesia’s West Java province. Local officials said 150 students from an Islamic high school were participating in the cleanup on Friday along the banks of the Cileueur river when 21 of them slipped into the water. “The weather was good and there was no flash flood,” said Deden Ridwansyah, the chief of the Bandung search and rescue office. “Those children who drowned were holding each others’ hands. One of them slipped and the others followed.”  Nearby residents and a rescue team managed to save 10 of the students, who were sent to a nearby hospital. Rescuers used big orange inflatable rafts to search for victims and all students were accounted for when the search ended on Friday night. The students apparently were not wearing flotation devices. Some reports said they were trying to cross the river, which is popular for rafting and inner tubing, when they fell in. Rains cause frequent landslides and flash floods in Indonesia, where millions of people live in mountainous areas or near flood plains. In February 2020, a flash flood killed at least six students who drowned in a river in the Sleman district of Yogyakarta province.\n",

      "Heiko Rischer isn’t quite sure how to describe the taste of lab-grown coffee. This summer he sampled one of the first batches in the world produced from cell cultures rather than coffee beans. “To describe it is difficult but, for me, it was in between a coffee and a black tea,” said Rischer, head of plant biotechnology at the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, which developed the coffee. “It depends really on the roasting grade, and this was a bit of a lighter roast, so it had a little bit more of a tea-like sensation.” Rischer couldn’t swallow the coffee, as this cellular agriculture innovation is not yet approved for public consumption. Instead, he swirled the liquid around in his mouth and spit it out. He predicts that VTT’s lab-grown coffee could get regulatory approval in Europe and the US in about four years’ time, paving the way for a commercialized product that could have a much lower climate impact than conventional coffee. The coffee industry is both a contributor to the climate crisis and very vulnerable to its effects. Rising demand for coffee has been linked to deforestation in developing nations, damaging biodiversity and releasing carbon emissions. At the same time, coffee producers are struggling with the impacts of more extreme weather, from frosts to droughts. It’s estimated that half of the land used to grow coffee could be unproductive by 2050 due to the climate crisis. In response to the industry’s challenges, companies and scientists are trying to develop and commercialize coffee made without coffee beans. VTT’s coffee is grown by floating cell cultures in bioreactors filled with a nutrient. The process requires no pesticides and has a much lower water footprint, said Rischer, and because the coffee can be produced in local markets, it cuts transport emissions. The company is working on a life cycle analysis of the process. “Once we have those figures, we will be able to show that the environmental impact will be much lower than what we have with conventional cultivation,” Rischer said. American startups are also working on beanless coffee. In September, Seattle-based Atomo Coffee released what it called the world’s first “molecular coffee” in a one-day online pop-up, charging $5.99 a can. The startup, which has raised $11.5m, makes its coffee by converting the compounds from plant waste into the same compounds contained in green coffee. Ingredients, including date seed extracts, chicory root, grape skin as well as caffeine, are roasted, ground and brewed. This method results in 93% lower carbon emissions and 94% less water use than conventional coffee production, as well as no deforestation, according to Atomo. “The industry has known about the deleterious effects of coffee farming for a long time, whether we’re talking deforestation or major water usage,” said Atomo’s co-founder Jarret Stopforth. “[Before starting Atomo] I was thinking to myself, ‘There’s got to be a better way to do this.’” Atomo’s facility can produce about 1,000 servings of coffee a day. The goal is to increase that to 10,000 servings a day over the next 12 months, said Stopforth, and in two years to move into a facility that can produce 30m servings of coffee a year. Stopforth says that Atomo will start the initial phase of the new factory build within the next three months. Alternative coffee companies like Atomo not only have the potential to help tackle the climate crisis but to benefit the industry generally, said Sylvain Charlebois, a professor in food distribution and policy at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Take arabica beans, said Charlebois. “You need specific climatic patterns, and it’s much better if you’re more in control in a laboratory environment than just trying to rely on Mother Nature.” Technology can help stabilize production and make it more predictable, he said. But it’s unclear how many people would be willing to give up conventional coffee for one of its beanless counterparts. A 2019 survey by Dalhousie University found that 72% of Canadians say they would not drink lab-grown coffee. Maricel Saenz, founder and CEO of San Francisco-based Compound Foods said she was working to “reinvent” coffee and to show people why doing so matters. Compound Foods, which has secured $4.5m in seed funding, says it recreates coffee farm production in the lab. The startup uses microbes and fermentation technology to grow a variety of flavors and aromas, Saenz said.  Preliminary results from a carbon life cycle analysis indicate that the company’s coffee produces a tenth of the greenhouse gas emissions and water use of traditional coffee, Saenz said. She plans to introduce her product by late 2022 and expects pricing to be similar to specialty coffees. “As we improve our processes, we aim to decrease our prices,” she said. As the population grows and pressure increases on natural resources, Saenz said, “we need to be producing food in more efficient ways, using a lot of the biotechnology and fermentation tools that are now at our disposal.” But Daniele Giovannucci, president and co-founder of the Committee on Sustainability Assessment, a consortium that focuses on agricultural sustainability, is concerned that scaling up lab-grown coffee could affect the livelihoods of the millions of workers in the traditional coffee industry, especially in countries such as Ethiopia where coffee is central to the economy. “What’s going to happen to all these people?” Giovannucci asked. “What are they going to do, because this is a key cash crop?” There’s a risk, he said, that lab-grown coffee could create significant socio-economic problems that could drive even greater climate change effects. “It is not clear if, in the end, its net effect may worsen global sustainability, along with many millions of lives.” Saenz, who is from Costa Rica, a coffee-exporting country, said, “I know many coffee producers, so it’s something that I definitely worry about.” But, she added, “the number one threat that coffee farmers have today is climate change” – whether that’s heat that disrupts ripening times, or unexpected frosts as Brazil experienced in the summer, which severely damaged crops. Saenz said her company will collaborate with non-profits to support small coffee farmers transitioning to more sustainable agricultural practices, including providing training and crop insurance. While lab-grown coffee shows real promise, said Charlebois, the politics should not be underestimated, especially as so many farmers depend on conventional methods of producing crops and many of them live in developing economies. “Scalability is not an issue for lab-grown coffee,” he said, “but regulations and general acceptance of the technology will be greater challenges.”\n",
      "Heiko Rischer isn’t quite sure how to describe the taste of lab-grown coffee. This summer he sampled one of the first batches in the world produced from cell cultures rather than coffee beans. “To describe it is difficult but, for me, it was in between a coffee and a black tea,” said Rischer, head of plant biotechnology at the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, which developed the coffee. “It depends really on the roasting grade, and this was a bit of a lighter roast, so it had a little bit more of a tea-like sensation.” Rischer couldn’t swallow the coffee, as this cellular agriculture innovation is not yet approved for public consumption. Instead, he swirled the liquid around in his mouth and spit it out. He predicts that VTT’s lab-grown coffee could get regulatory approval in Europe and the US in about four years’ time, paving the way for a commercialized product that could have a much lower climate impact than conventional coffee. The coffee industry is both a contributor to the climate crisis and very vulnerable to its effects. Rising demand for coffee has been linked to deforestation in developing nations, damaging biodiversity and releasing carbon emissions. At the same time, coffee producers are struggling with the impacts of more extreme weather, from frosts to droughts. It’s estimated that half of the land used to grow coffee could be unproductive by 2050 due to the climate crisis. In response to the industry’s challenges, companies and scientists are trying to develop and commercialize coffee made without coffee beans. VTT’s coffee is grown by floating cell cultures in bioreactors filled with a nutrient. The process requires no pesticides and has a much lower water footprint, said Rischer, and because the coffee can be produced in local markets, it cuts transport emissions. The company is working on a life cycle analysis of the process. “Once we have those figures, we will be able to show that the environmental impact will be much lower than what we have with conventional cultivation,” Rischer said. American startups are also working on beanless coffee. In September, Seattle-based Atomo Coffee released what it called the world’s first “molecular coffee” in a one-day online pop-up, charging $5.99 a can. The startup, which has raised $11.5m, makes its coffee by converting the compounds from plant waste into the same compounds contained in green coffee. Ingredients, including date seed extracts, chicory root, grape skin as well as caffeine, are roasted, ground and brewed. This method results in 93% lower carbon emissions and 94% less water use than conventional coffee production, as well as no deforestation, according to Atomo. “The industry has known about the deleterious effects of coffee farming for a long time, whether we’re talking deforestation or major water usage,” said Atomo’s co-founder Jarret Stopforth. “[Before starting Atomo] I was thinking to myself, ‘There’s got to be a better way to do this.’” Atomo’s facility can produce about 1,000 servings of coffee a day. The goal is to increase that to 10,000 servings a day over the next 12 months, said Stopforth, and in two years to move into a facility that can produce 30m servings of coffee a year.

      "Two teenagers are curled up on a sofa, asleep in each other’s arms. On the kitchen floor close by, an adult lies in a pool of blood. Soon the police will be on their way and the siblings, who were abused and neglected as children, will pay a heavy price for what they have done.  This is is a dramatic scene from Fit, the debut novel by Sammy Wright, a deputy headteacher and until this month a member of the Social Mobility Commission. His book, which evolved from his experience as a teacher, is so haunting that I found myself thinking – and even dreaming – about it days after I’d finished reading it. It has already won the Northern Book prize.  Wright, who works at Southmoor academy in Sunderland, says experience in schools has shown him that it’s extremely difficult for young people to bounce back from adverse childhood experiences. “Ask any teacher and they will tell you the character of Jack in my book – a kid who’s been abused and now acts abusively towards other kids – is not an unusual figure. Nor is Rose – a girl who’s been neglected and is sexually exploited as a teenager.” The root cause of many children’s problems is poverty, he says. “If you want to get rid of child poverty, there’s a dead easy way and it’s called money. Give people money and they’re no longer poor. It’s not rocket science, actually: adequate welfare nets, good family hubs and good jobs in the area. That kind of stuff really helps.” The Social Mobility Commission, an advisory body of the Department for Education, was set up in 2012 under the coalition government. It has a chequered history. In 2017, all four members of the board, including the former health secretary Alan Milburn, resigned in protest at the lack of progress made by Theresa May’s government. Wright joined in 2018 and became lead commissioner for schools and higher education in 2019. His three-year stint ends just as Katharine Birbalsingh, controversial head of the super-strict Michaela school in Wembley, is announced as the new chief commissioner. During Wright’s three years, the commission did its best, he says, but was thwarted by the government. “Every political decision seems to be made with short-term goals in sight. And it is bullshit.” Of the “levelling up” agenda, he says: “I think it’s a priority of the government to sound like they’re focused on this. If they want to do more than that, they need to direct funding and investment to areas of need, not just areas of political sensitivity.” Birbalsingh is, he says, well qualified for the job – and may even have a chance to get through to ministers. “I have a great deal of admiration for what she’s achieved, and hope her personal credibility will mean she’ll be able to give important messages in ways the government might listen.” His advice to her? “To remember that the basic equation in social mobility is very simple, and backed by a ton of evidence: equal societies are mobile societies. And the headwinds are strong – she will need to push hard to get concrete funding or policy decisions.”  He feels he and his commission colleagues did their best. “We’re proud of what we achieved – some brilliant research, a clear framework for how to measure social mobility and a real shift in the narrative around place-based inequality and what employers can do. “But if you measure our success by recommendations actually enacted by government, then it’s pretty bleak. I don’t think it can be anything else when the universal credit cut has just gone through, and the two-child cap on benefits remains.” Wright applied for the role on a whim. “It was all a bit accidental. I’d been doing outreach stuff with Oxford and Durham universities, running a centre in our school that was all about social mobility.” Once appointed, he was able to carry on at school, where he teaches English as well as being deputy head. During lockdown, a lot of the work went online, so he managed to fit in everything by working early and late. He gets into school at 7.15am and leaves each day at 5.30pm. Working remotely for the commission allowed him to take on more work: “I could basically say yes to anything.” During the pandemic, as well as working on education recovery measures, he led the commission’s investigation, Against the Odds, into what can be learned from schools that are closing the progress gap and achieving better outcomes for disadvantaged pupils.  The key policy he has fought for is better funding for pupils aged 16 to 19 in education: he thinks the pupil premium should be extended for disadvantaged students in this age group. “That’s what I’ve been discussing with ministers and other organisations all year,” he says. When I ask how the discussions went, he sighs: “Education ministers seemed receptive to the idea, but it’s all about the spending review: whether the money’s there.” The spending review is expected on 27 October. “If there is one thing, it should be 16-19 education funding,” he says. Wright is already working on his second novel, partly set in the same fictional northern town. “I’ve been teaching for 20 years and I’ve been writing all that time.” He writes intensively during the holidays, at evenings and weekends. “I’m just compulsive about it. If I don’t do it, I get unhappy.” This is his first published novel, but he had completed six full-length manuscripts: “It’s been a long learning curve.” His mother, a social worker and counsellor, set up a centre for survivors of incest in Edinburgh, and his father was a lecturer at Edinburgh university. As a child, he attended Sciennes primary, a state school, then got a scholarship to the Edinburgh academy, a private secondary school. “I’ve always had cultural capital and I think that’s what’s given me a sense of mission. I feel there’s quite a heavy debt I need to pay, in terms of social mobility.” He went on to study English at Oxford, and always wanted to be a teacher. He recalls one tutor telling him: “It will grind you down, my dear. Don’t do it.” He laughs at the recollection.  He spent 12 years teaching in London, at William Ellis school and then Fortismere, before moving to the north-east to set up the sixth form at Southmoor, where more than a quarter of pupils are eligible for free school meals and he feels he has more to offer the children.  The move north gave him what he calls his “political edge”. “Even compared to the disadvantaged students I taught in London, the students I teach in Sunderland are much more fragile in their sense of self, in their aspirations. While they are just as bright, just as interesting and just as capable, their frame of reference is much narrower. Many of them literally don’t know people who do fancy careers – they don’t encounter jobs much beyond care services and manual trades.” Wright has taught children who were “really seriously neglected, to the point where they would steal food in the school”. He decided to write a novel that would reflect the reality of life for many teenagers suffering abuse, neglect or personal tragedy. “I wanted to recognise those kids – the ones who aren’t the stars that shine, but have a lot going on in the background.” He finds the government’s approach to education frustrating. “What we need to do is sit down and think: what do kids need at the age of five, eight, 10, 15, 20? Let’s put it in place, have it planned and sequential and ensure it makes sense. Yet what we’ve got is this patchwork of nonsense that’s been accrued since the 1960s, just mishmashed together with various reforms that have been either half-arsed or overenthusiastic. Why can’t we have something better? Why can’t we take the control of education away from being such a political football?” He is highly critical of those in power who say they want an equal society but fail to act on it. “What we do at the moment is say we want equal opportunity for all, but we don’t put our money where our mouth is. We don’t care enough. We need to do that. Otherwise it’s going to get worse.” Fit by Sammy Wright is published by And Other Stories on 21 October.\n",

      "The billionaire space race is only a race by name. In actuality, there is SpaceX – and everyone else. Only the company founded by Elon Musk nearly two decades ago has sent an orbital rocket booster into space and landed it safely again. Only SpaceX has landed a rocket the size of a 15-storey building on a drone ship in the middle of the ocean. Only SpaceX has carried both Nasa astronauts and private citizens to the International Space Station. Only SpaceX is producing thousands of its own table-sized communication satellites every year. Only SpaceX has the almost weekly launch cadence necessary to single-handedly double the number of operational satellites in orbit in less than two years. Only SpaceX is launching prototypes of the largest and most powerful rocket ever made, a behemoth called Starship that is destined to carry humans to the moon. SpaceX’s total dominance of the rocket industry is not what you would expect. There is more innovation happening in the commercial space sector today than at any time in history and the launch services sector is particularly competitive. Relativity Space is building the world’s first 3D-printed rocket and plans to build rockets on Mars with robots. Virgin Orbit is putting satellites into orbit by launching a rocket from beneath the wing of a jumbo jet. Its sister company, Virgin Galactic, is flying people to the edge of space from an air-launched space plane. RocketLab has developed the first rocket engine fed with an electric pump and is trying to catch it out of the air with a net connected to a helicopter. And then there’s Blue Origin, which dominated world headlines for days this week with its launch of the Star Trek actor William Shatner – briefly – into space. If there were any rocket company expected to be at a comparable level of technological achievement to SpaceX, it is Blue Origin. The company was founded by the former Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos in 2000, just two years before SpaceX set up shop in California. In 2015, Blue Origin became the first company to send a rocket above the Kármán Line, the internationally recognized boundary of space, and land it again. While this is not as challenging as bringing a rocket back from orbit – as Musk has taunted Bezos in the past – it was still a major milestone in the history of private space exploration. And unlike Musk, Bezos actually knows what it’s like to ride on his own rocket. Bezos founded Blue Origin with visionary goals. Inspired by the late Princeton futurist Gerard K O’Neill, Bezos dreams of moving heavy industry off of Earth and into space to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. He wants to lay the foundation for an extra-terrestrial economy where thousands of people are living and working in space. His company is building a rocket as powerful as the one that carried Apollo astronauts to the moon and has partnered with leading defense contractors including Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Draper to develop a lunar lander that could bring humans back to the lunar surface. It has designed and built one of the most powerful rocket engines ever made and inked contracts with the United Launch Alliance to supply the engine for its next generation Vulcan rocket. There’s no doubt that Bezos has plenty of vision. The question is: why can’t the second richest man in the world execute on it? Over the past few years, Blue Origin’s master plan has begun unraveling. Earlier this year, Nasa awarded its lunar lander contract to SpaceX, leaving Blue Origin in the lurch. It’s now suing the US government to reconsider the award. It’s seen an exodus of top engineering talent following the lost contract, which has only exacerbated its already considerable delays. Blue Origin has struggled to hit its stride producing its powerful BE-4 rocket engine and as a result the maiden launch of ULA’s Vulcan rocket has slipped to late 2022. This will make the first flight of the engine a full five years behind schedule. Meanwhile, the first flight of the company’s fabled New Glenn rocket, a heavy launch vehicle capable of hoisting nearly 100,000 pounds into low Earth orbit, has also been pushed to late 2022 at the earliest. It was originally meant to fly for the first time last year. Bezos didn’t even get the glory of being the first billionaire to ride his own rocket into space. Just two weeks before Bezos flew to the edge of space this summer, Richard Branson completed a suborbital flight in his own spaceplane with Virgin Galactic. How did this happen? Blue Origin employs thousands of the world’s top rocket engineers. The company also has access to a virtually unlimited supply of money. Bezos, who is worth just south of $200bn, spends $1bn a year out of his own pocket to fund Blue Origin. By all measures, Blue Origin should be one of the most successful space companies in the world. “Blue Origin has all the ingredients for success and to become something truly fantastic,” said Ally Abrams, the former head of Blue Origin employee communications who recently wrote a whistleblower essay detailing safety concerns and rampant sexism at the company. “The engineers really believed that and they try every day to make that a reality despite the leadership’s interventions.” According to Abrams, Blue Origin’s troubles have both a technical and cultural dimension. On the technical side, Abrams said the company suffers from an immense amount of technical debt–engineering challenges that build up as a result of choosing a quick solution rather than the best solution – and a relentless focus on speed that undermined its ability to properly address problems with its launch vehicles. She explained the exodus of top talent from Blue Origin as engineers who “got tired of putting Band-Aids on problems”. “Technical debt is a problem most companies have but at Blue it’s just on an incredible scale,” Abrams said. “It really failed to transition from an R&D company to a production company.” Abrams partially attributes the mounting technical debt to Blue Origin’s increasing focus on speed, an irony for a company whose motto is Gradatim Ferociter, the Latin rendering of “step by step, ferociously”. She traces the mounting pressure to move fast to 2017, when it was clear the company was failing to keep pace with its rivals at SpaceX. She said Bezos’s growing impatience with the pace of development was palpable, as was the “jealousy he seemed to have for the other billionaires who seemed to be making more progress than him”. “The schedule was always a huge joke within the company,” Abrams said. “We’d put out the dates externally and employees would laugh because they knew that just wasn’t possible.” But Blue Origin was racked by more than just engineering difficulties. In her essay, Abrams described a company where executives show “consistently inappropriate” behavior toward women and where “dissent is actively stifled”. According to Abrams, Blue Origin’s cultural problems started at the top and flowed down throughout the company. She said Blue Origin’s CEO, Bob Smith, who was tapped by Bezos to lead the company in 2017, repeatedly failed to listen to his employees’ concerns about the safety of the company’s vehicles and its toxic workplace culture. “Bob Smith is one of the most incapable leaders I have ever encountered,” Abrams said. “Passion withers in his presence. Plenty of engineers didn’t feel comfortable raising safety and quality concerns for fear of retaliation, which is a very scary thing when you’re working on a high-risk, experimental vehicle.” Abrams’ whistleblower essay was co-signed by 20 anonymous current and former Blue Origin employees. Many of its allegations were denied by the company. A statement from Blue Origin said the company had dismissed Abrams for “repeated warnings for issues involving federal export control regulations”, that the company has no tolerance for harassment or discrimination, and that it believes its New Shepard rocket is “the safest space vehicle ever designed or built”. “It is particularly difficult and painful, for me, to hear claims being levied that attempt to characterize our entire team in a way that doesn’t align with the character and capability that I see at Blue Origin every day,” Smith wrote in an internal email to Blue Origin employees earlier this month. “As always, I welcome and encourage any member of Team Blue to speak directly with me if they have any concerns on any topic at any time.” Still, Blue Origin employees continue to speak out. Earlier this week, an investigation by the Washington Post echoed the issues raised by Abrams and painted a picture of an organization riddled with distrust of its leadership, sexism and insufficient concern for the safety of its launch vehicles. Looking to the future, the question for Blue Origin is whether it can overhaul its culture to deliver on its mission. Many observers, including Abrams, are skeptical. But perhaps a change is imminent. Earlier this year, Bezos stepped down from his role as the CEO of Amazon and committed himself to spending more time focused on Blue Origin. Whether Bezos can reinvigorate the company’s culture with his grand vision for human space exploration and a sense of common purpose remains to be seen. “There’s going to be a lot of work and a lot of healing to do if they can actually put a good leadership team in place that is committed to moving forward in a different way,” said Abrams. “I think it would still take years for the scar tissue to heal with the employees.” The only thing that’s certain is Bezos will never have his colonies in space if he can’t build the rockets to get there – and that may be a problem that no amount of money can fix.\n",
      "It was another starry night in Hollywood. In a white-walled room at the Milk Studios art gallery, where a lone violinist played before a projected animation, musician Moby, artist Shepard Fairey and Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti reportedly mingled with about 200 guests. On display were artworks that combine canvas, yupo paper, wood and metal with oil, acrylic, ink and the written word. Organizers hope they will sell for up to half a million dollars – unusually high for an emerging artist. But then, this artist also happens to be son of the president of the United States. Hunter Biden’s potentially lucrative new career – he is represented by the Georges Bergès Gallery in New York, which credits him with “powerful and impactful paintings ranging from photogenic to mixed media to the abstract” – is presenting ethical headaches for a White House that has promised to lead by example. Experts have raised alarms that individuals might buy the artworks – expected to fetch between $75,000 and $500,000 – to try to curry favor and gain influence with Joe Biden. They also accuse Hunter of trading on his father’s name and position in a manner that, while not illegal, flouts ethical norms. “I find it deeply troubling,” said Walter Shaub, who was director of the Office of Government Ethics under President Barack Obama. “Merely following the incredibly weak ethics rules that we have doesn’t win you any points and the legalistic approach blinds you to obvious commonsense problems. And here we have an obvious problem. “We’ve got a family member clearly trading on his father’s name. The man has never sold a piece of art before, has never even juried into a community centre art show, but suddenly he’s selling art at fantastical prices. There is simply no way anybody paid $75,000 for anything other than his name.” Biden has always been a fierce defender of Hunter, 51, who has been dogged by controversies for years and whose tax affairs are currently under investigation by the justice department. Donald Trump’s attempts to weaponise Hunter’s problems for political gain in the 2020 presidential election fell flat. Earlier this year Hunter published a memoir in which he detailed his struggle with alcoholism and drug abuse and denied wrongdoing in joining the board of Burisma, a gas company in Ukraine, where he earned more than $50,000 a month from 2014 to 2019. Again, he did not inflict political damage on his father as some feared. But his latest pursuit, painting, could prove more complicated. Hunter said in a New York Times interview last year that he took it up as a hobby during his recovery from addiction and found solace in art when he was at the centre of Trump’s 2019 impeachment trial. In July he told the Nota Bene: This Week in the Art World podcast that art prices are “completely subjective”, insisting: “Look, man, I never set my prices – what my art was going to cost, what it costs or how much it would be priced at. I would be amazed, you know, if my art had sold at, um, you know, for $10.” The sale of his work, however. appears to be cutting through as a media narrative in a way that lurid rightwing conspiracy theories never did. Just as President Jimmy Carter’s younger brother marketed and sold “Billy Beer” in 1977, Hunter faces accusations that he is cashing in. Shaub, now a senior fellow at the Project on Government Oversight watchdog, commented: “You hear people trying to justify it by saying, ‘Well, of course, he’s famous, he’s the president’s son,’ but that’s the exact problem because he may not be in public office and there may be no laws that apply to him but he is a citizen whose father happens to be the leader of the country and so he has a patriotic duty to not run around trying to capitalise on that relationship. “Sure, he’s not a criminal if he fails to comply with that duty, but he’s not a patriot either. He’s not a man who cares about a country that has just been through a four-year ethical nightmare. He sees an opportunity for profiteering and says, ‘Well, you know, it’s legal. I’m just going to do it. Who cares what that does to my country?’” The conflict-of-interest concerns cast a shadow over efforts by the president – who likes to vow “my word as a Biden” – to show the world that America has turned the corner after the constant allegations that Trump’s business and family benefited from his office, including the appointment of his daughter and son-in-law to senior White House positions. Biden issued a memorandum establishing fighting corruption as a core national security interest. His administration responded to the Pandora Papers by promising to push for greater transparency in financial systems. It sought to pre-empt questions over Hunter’s art by striking an agreement, first reported by the Washington Post in July, under which the gallery owner, Georges Bergès, would set the prices of the art and not reveal who bid on or bought it, as well as rejecting offers that seemed extortionate. But there is no mechanism to monitor the agreement. Critics say Hunter’s presence at the recent gallery event in Hollywood undercut claims that neither he nor the White House would know the identity of buyers. And Garcetti, who also attended, is Biden’s nominee to be the next US ambassador to India and a former national co-chair of his 2020 presidential campaign. The issue was given short shrift this week by Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary. She told a reporter at the daily briefing: “It still is the purview of the gallerist. We still do not know and will not know who purchases any paintings. And the president remains proud of his son.” When the reporter tried to follow up, Psaki interjected sharply: “Did you have another question on something else?” Shaub condemned her manner as “surly” and described the agreement to keep buyers anonymous as “an insult to our intelligence”. He explained: “Anybody who spends tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy art because it was created by the president’s son is going to be very open and vocal about the fact that they bought it. It’s going to be the showpiece at cocktail parties and so that information will eventually come out. This is a farce.” Some commentators have argued that transparency would work better than secrecy, allowing the public to know whether a buyer such as a political lobbyist had paid a suspiciously high price. When the Guardian called the Georges Bergès Gallery, it was told to send an email and did so, but did not receive a reply. When the Guardian called the Milk Studios, which hosted Hunter’s show, a man twice answered and twice hung up. Ethics expert Kathleen Clark, a professor at Washington University School of Law, joined criticism of the arrangement. “It’s really unfortunate that Hunter Biden has chosen to attempt to make money in a way that is vulnerable to influence peddling. “Now, he’s an adult and the ethics standards that bind elected officials and civil servants don’t apply to him directly. On the other hand, not all forms of compensated work have this kind of vulnerability but this kind of work does because it’s so difficult to know exactly what the value of a painting is.” The previous White House set a historically low bar, Clark added. “The Trump administration gave the impression that they were attempting to be unethical, like that was the goal, like they were seeking some kind of championship bid in unethical if not criminal conduct. It’s nothing like that. But it still could be a disappointment when the Biden administration doesn’t live up to what it might do in terms of transparency, for example.” Indeed, the sheer breadth and depth of Trump scandals that captivated the media for four years might have partially shielded Biden and Hunter from sustained scrutiny. A recent book on the Biden family by the Politico journalist Ben Schreckinger presents evidence that some emails allegedly leaked from Hunter’s laptop regarding business deals were genuine and not, as widely assumed, planted by Russian intelligence. Shaub suggested that many people are blinded to the ethical problem of the artwork for two reasons. “One is just the hyper-partisanship that has evolved in our country and so people who voted for Biden run around saying, ‘Well, it’s not as bad as Trump.’ “Of course it’s not even close to as bad as Trump but ‘better than Trump’ should never, ever, ever become the standard in this country because that’s saying, ‘I’m better than the absolute worst that prior to 2016 you couldn’t have even conceived of.’” He continued: “The second thing that’s blinding people is that there was a lot of unfair smearing of Hunter Biden by very well-funded political actors who were completely disingenuous in their ridiculous accusations. I guess that worked well with their base but it really clouded the issue because the truth is Hunter Biden is not the villain these political actors make him out to be. “But he’s also not the upstanding citizen that the White House wants you to believe. This is a man whose entire life has been is based off of making money on his father’s political career and that is not something we should embrace in this country and celebrate and tolerate. So two things can be true at the same time.” US allies around the world have been looking at the US for evidence that the country has stabilized in the aftermath of Trump’s presidency, Shaub said. “Yeah, we have a new administration that isn’t rampantly thumbing its nose at the rule of law, but it is going right up to the line and saying, if it’s legal, we’re going to do it and we’re not going to focus on reforms, we’re not going to focus on setting a squeaky clean tone, we’re going to go back to the way things were before Trump.”\n",
      "Instagram has attracted a firestorm after whistleblower Frances Haugen revealed internal research showing the platform downplayed proof of its toxic effects – including the rise of eating disorders – on children. But such issues are not limited to the Facebook-owned social media company. The Guardian has found a variety of harmful pro-anorexia hashtags remain searchable on the popular video-sharing app TikTok, where corresponding videos have billions of views combined. TikTok officially does not allow content promoting or glorifying eating disorders, and enforces such a ban through human and AI moderation. The platform in 2020 imposed additional restrictions on weight-loss ads after facing criticism for promoting dangerous diets, and in March launched a program to connect users who search hashtags related to eating disorders with a helpline. But at least two dozen problematic hashtags have managed to slip through the cracks, the Guardian found. “TikTok as a platform is flying under the radar right now,” said Bridget Todd, a spokesperson for UltraViolet, a women’s advocacy group. “Everybody knows that Facebook and Instagram have a huge potential for harm when it comes to younger audiences, but we are not talking enough about the dangers of these newer platforms,” she added. Todd said that TikTok, compared with Instagram, may actually be “more dangerous” because of the demographics of its users. The video app surpassed 1 billion active monthly users in September, 60% of whom are between the ages of 16 and 24. TikTok-specific features have prompted a number of concerns unique to the platform, research from UltraViolet found. TikTok’s “For You” page, a feed of videos from accounts users may not even follow that is recommended by an algorithm based on viewing history, makes it possible for problematic content to start “trending” with little friction. One experiment by the Lowy Institute found, for example, that TikTok’s politically neutral feed turned conservative and far-right in just a day of looping, liking and sharing certain content. Efforts by the Guardian to engage with diet content led to full-blown eating disorder promotion in less than 24 hours. The popular hashtag #WhatIEatInADay, for example, soon led to #ketodiet videos – then more restrictive diets and eventually overtly unhealthy hashtags such as #Iwillbeskinny and #thinspoa. Todd said TikTok’s use of augmented reality camera filters can also contribute to negative body image, especially for young girls. While both Snapchat and Instagram have said they won’t allow filters that promote or mimic plastic surgery, TikTok has dozens of beauty filters that let young girls change their skin, face shape, body shape and more. “This contributes to creating an impossible standard of beauty,” she said. UltraViolet has launched a petition that has garnered more than 2,000 signatures calling on TikTok to disable such filters on the accounts of teens. The organization has also called on TikTok to remove all advertisement of weight loss and diet supplement products, and asked it to prevent loopholes for disordered eating hashtags and provide resources from accredited medical and nutrition boards on potentially inflammatory content. “When you’re dealing with a really young and impressionable user base, there is not room for half measures,” Todd said. “We need to make sure this is meaningfully dealt with, and that means not allowing any of this content on the platform.” A spokeswoman for TikTok said the platform works to balance censorship of problematic content with efforts to encourage content that is related to prevention of eating disorders, avoiding removal of some eating disorder hashtags that may be used for educational purposes. TikTok works with the National Eating Disorders Association to provide educational resources for users and restrict ads for fasting apps and weight loss supplements, she added. “We care deeply about the wellbeing of our community and strive to foster a community where everyone feels not only included, but celebrated,” she said. Jonna Nielsen, a 17-year-old who lives in Pennsylvania, said she began struggling with an eating disorder she feels was worsened by social media at age 15. Her symptoms began to intensify when she viewed a variety of diet and exercise content on Instagram. The algorithm then led her to more posts about restricting food, intermittent fasting and, ultimately, explicitly pro-anorexia content such as guides on how to hide an eating disorder from parents. After spending several months in a recovery center, Nielsen said her disease was in remission. But when she returned to her “normal life”, she downloaded TikTok to connect with friends and was quickly plunged back into the middle of similar content. “Everyone was sharing about how skinny they were, about how they weren’t eating, and I started to feel left out,” she said. “I wanted to stay recovered, but I started to get in this mindset that I wasn’t good enough if I didn’t look like that.” Nielsen mentioned one of TikTok’s most popular trends, #WhatIEatInADay. The hashtag has thousands of videos with a combined 8.9bn views, including one popular video from Kylie Jenner with 14.7m likes.  “People use #WhatIEatInADay to brag about their diet, and it is often not even enough food for a toddler,” said Nielsen. “It is ruining the idea of what it means to be healthy for people my age.” Nielsen said she felt her eating disorder was triggered not only by the explicitly pro-eating disorder hashtags, but also by the unrealistic standards of beauty pushed by the app. TikTok’s algorithm and moderators have been shown in the past to favor the content of thin, white users. TikTok is, paradoxically, also home to a variety of eating disorder recovery communities. TikTok said it promotes positive content with in-app highlights of hashtags such as #bodypositivity, which has 15.3bn views, and #bodyacceptance, which has 214m views. One creator on the platform went viral in 2020 for her “eat with me” series encouraging users recovering from eating disorders to unite on the app to make healthy eating choices. Hashtags such as #edrecovery are also popular with users documenting their struggles with eating disorders. However, health experts say such content could also have downsides. One National Institute of Health study published in January found that while pro-anorexia videos have a clear negative impact on users, “anti pro-anorexia” videos aimed at raising awareness of the consequences of anorexia may also provoke disordered eating. “Our case shows how even these safer videos paradoxically lead the users to emulate these ‘guilty’ behaviors,” the study said. Nielsen said she sees many users purportedly sharing recovery from eating disorders while – intentionally or not – promoting some of the behaviors they claim to discourage. “It is almost just as bad when you see these recovery accounts which are really just seeking attention by talking about how little they weigh, or how bad their eating disorders are – that is not actually helping people in recovery,” she said. Nielsen said she ultimately has deleted TikTok, Instagram and all other social media because she feels it is impossible to use them in a healthy way. “It spreads like a disease,” she said of eating disorders. “One person talks about it, then another person gets the idea to do the same thing. These platforms need to crack down on it because it is ruining people’s lives.”\n",
      "Monica Fast Horse texted her 26-year-old daughter on a Thursday evening in August to ask when she would be home. It wasn’t fear that drove her to it, it was simply what they always did: they checked in with each other. Fast Horse and her daughter Jenna Charging Crow lived together in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, along with another one of Fast Horse’s daughters and Charging Crow’s five-year-old daughter, Jenelle. Fast Horse, a member of the Oglala Lakota Tribe, helped raise her granddaughter, and Charging Crow served as primary caretaker for her mother as she dealt with the medical complications of end-stage kidney failure. Earlier in the week, the pair had been excitedly preparing outfits for Jenelle’s upcoming first day of kindergarten. Fast Horse said she remembered Charging Crow’s amazement that her daughter was going to be starting school in a matter of days, and was also looking toward her own first day at a new job at Wendy’s. That Thursday evening, Charging Crow went to her friend’s apartment, about a three-minute drive away. She was supposed to be out just a few hours, so all Charging Crow wore on her feet were slippers,, according to Fast Horse. But as the night went on, Fast Horse’s curiosity became concern. By the next day it had morphed into fear. “She would always, always check in with me,” Fast Horse told the Guardian. “I swear even in the past when we’ve had our differences and we’ve argued and stuff she would always call me or text me and say, ‘Mom, did you eat today?’ or ‘did you and baby eat today?’ or ‘how’s my baby doing?’” By the afternoon, Fast Horse said she called the Sioux Falls police department and filed a missing person’s report. About two hours later she said officers came to her home, took her statement and then went to the apartment complex her daughter had visited. For five agonizing days the family searched the area, covering stores and street poles with missing persons flyers and emailing and calling local news organizations before Fast Horse heard from the detective assigned to her daughter’s case. Her daughter has now been missing almost two months, and she has never heard back from any of the news organizations she contacted. “I never thought this would ever happen to me,” she said. “I’ve seen other posters, I’ve seen other notices, but I never thought it would happen to my kid. And going through this with the police department and people not helping you and not caring about you or not worrying about that.” Sgt Robert Forster with the Sioux Falls police department said he couldn’t speak directly to the case because it was an active investigation, but said that the detective on the case had been “working it diligently”. When asked about the amount of time that elapsed before Fast Horse was contacted, he explained that in some cases there may be a lag time because officers received an incorrect phone number for the family, or the detective was off for the weekend, or it came down to having to prioritize based on the day’s caseload. This year, he said, 10 detectives will be investigating as many as 800 cases, so “we have to prioritize those.” There has long been a devastating epidemic of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls in the US. Yet too often their cases receive little to no news media attention and their families can face doubts and delays from law enforcement agencies. The tragic case of Gabby Petito, whose body was discovered late last month in a national park in Wyoming after a rapid-fire law enforcement response and national news media frenzy, only served to emphasize the disparity that often exists when a white woman is missing compared with when an Indigenous woman is reported missing. Although Petito’s and Charging Crow’s cases are very much distinct, and each is heart-wrenching in its own way, Petito’s family has received some tragic answers about what happened to her. Fast Horse and her family’s desperate search continues. Kerri Colfer, who is Tlingit and the National Indigenous Women’s Resource Center’s senior native affairs adviser, said she had noticed many instances where law enforcement officers have victim-blamed Native women and been slow to investigate or declare them missing. “That often means that the families end up leading the searches for their missing relatives, before law enforcement even tries to get involved,” she said. “And obviously, that is retraumatizing for families.” In 2018, the Urban Indian Health Institute released a report documenting hundreds of cases of missing and murdered American Indian and Alaska Native women and girls across 71 US cities. More than 150 of the cases they found were not included in law enforcement records. Its authors determined that more than 95% of the cases in the report had not received coverage by a national or international news agencies. Dr Patty Loew, professor at Northwestern University’s journalism school and director of its Center for Native American and Indigenous Research, said the lack of coverage is driven by many factors, including the misclassification of Native women, the geographical separation between reservations and urban areas where news agencies are often based, and reporters naturally wanting to “stay within their cultural comfort zones”. “I think news prefers people that sort of stay within the system and people of color who are assimilatory and want equal rights – that’s something we understand,” said Loew, who is a member of the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Ojibwe. “But I think reporters don’t really understand sovereignty, and people who have a political identity that exists outside the mainstream.” Since the Petito case, many news agencies have suddenly jumped into reporting on missing Native American women and have highlighted the disparity, bringing attention to specific cases of missing Indigenous people. The effect, according to Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women USA, has been at least eight Indigenous women and girls being found. One had been missing for about a year. “It shows representation in the media matters,” said Deborah Maytubee Shipman, the organization’s director and founder. “We try so much to bend into what everybody wants to see instead of what we are. And for the first time I think we’re being recognized for what we actually are, a person of color and not some other fourth class.” On 15 September, Janice Enriquez, a member of the Dry Creek Rancheria Band of Pomo Indians, filed a missing person’s report for her 16-year-old daughter, Bluujaye Enriquez, in Sacramento, California. The teenager, who is biracial, Native and Hispanic, had been at her boyfriend’s home. Her parents did not want her to see him, Enriquez said. When her father came to get her, Bluujaye took off without her phone or money. Enriquez said after five days went by and she hadn’t heard from her daughter, and no detective had been assigned to the case, she tried calling the investigations division. She left a voicemail. She said she heard from a detective on 23 September, the day after a local news station aired a story about Bluujaye – following several failed attempts to get coverage from a handful of other local stations. “I didn’t feel like I had a police force on my team,” she said. “I felt like they just didn’t care. They shouldn’t look at it like, ‘oh another kid’; ‘oh there’s so many’. It doesn’t matter. We shouldn’t be missing any.” On 24 September, law enforcement told Enriquez that Bluujaye might be at a local youth shelter. But just a few days later, she had run away from the facility, according to Enriquez. “It’s sad when you’re looking for your child that there’s no help,” she said. “People will say there’s all this help, but there is no help to search for your kid.” Enriquez said she finally received a call from her daughter on 8 October on a blocked number. She said she’s fine, but Enriquez said she’s still very worried about the teenager’s safety. In response to questions about how the investigation was handled and why days went by before Enriquez heard from a detective, Sgt Sabrina Briggs, with the Sacramento police department, said in an email: “When the report was received officers began a follow-up investigation which included attempting to contact known associates, checking possible locations, contacting local hospitals and resource providers to develop leads. All preliminary investigative leads were exhausted and there were no signs of foul play.” In April, Deb Haaland, the first Indigenous cabinet secretary in US history, announced the formation of a new unit centered on investigating missing and murdered Native Americans. In a statement she described the violence against Indigenous people as a “crisis that has been underfunded for decades”, saying that about 1,500 American Indian and Alaska Native people across the country are listed as missing in the National Crime Information Center. Colfer explained that there are actually many more missing Indigenous people that are not reflected in official numbers, due to such things as reporting problems and misidentification. She said while she was hopeful Haaland’s work could help bring attention to missing Indigenous people, she believed it would take much more than one approach from a single federal agency. It will take more resources at the federal, state and tribal levels devoted to searching for missing Native people, more communication between law enforcement and these families, and also an expansion of tribal jurisdiction through the Violence Against Women’s Act, she said. “We need all of the federal government to communicate on this and really make this a priority,” she said. “And so, I’m hoping that we see success from that specific unit, but that we also see commitment to this issue from all areas.” Over the past several weeks, there have been a number of reported sightings of Charging Crow, including one by law enforcement. Police found her in a vehicle with a man in late September. Fast Horse said he is a registered sex offender. When the police told her to call her mother, she asked for her phone number, which Fast Horse said was very concerning given that her daughter long had it memorized. The family has heard from some in the community that Charging Crow is being held and used to transport drugs because she owes someone a debt. When one of Fast Horse’s other daughters was able to get into her Facebook and Twitter accounts, she found that every few days Charging Crow logs in from a different neighboring state. Last week, Fast Horse was in the hospital for dialysis treatment when she received a call from a number she didn’t recognize. It was Charging Crow. She was crying and told her she missed her, and her daughter, but throughout the 1 minute and 55 second call, Fast Horse said her daughter sounded stilted and she kept hearing someone whispering next to the phone. Fast Horse asked her when she was coming back. She said her daughter replied: “They said that I was gonna be able to go home in a couple of weeks … Now I’m not sure.” When Fast Horse relayed all of this to the detective, she said he asked her if she might be out doing drugs and partying. She said her daughter would have never done that. Fast Horse said having her daughter disappear has been extraordinarily painful. But feeling like she doesn’t have any help from law enforcement or the media has made it much worse. “As a Native woman, usually we don’t cry in front of people – that’s how I was taught because I’m older. We don’t usually show our emotions to a lot of people, you know you just keep going, you get up and you keep going,” she said. “But this thing with my daughter gone has brought me to my knees.”\n",

Although Petito’s and Charging Crow’s cases are very much distinct, and each is heart-wrenching in its own way, Petito’s family has received some tragic answers about what happened to her. Fast Horse and her family’s desperate search continues. Kerri Colfer, who is Tlingit and the National Indigenous Women’s Resource Center’s senior native affairs adviser, said she had noticed many instances where law enforcement officers have victim-blamed Native women and been slow to investigate or declare them missing. “That often means that the families end up leading the searches for their missing relatives, before law enforcement even tries to get involved,” she said. “And obviously, that is retraumatizing for families.” In 2018, the Urban Indian Health Institute released a report documenting hundreds of cases of missing and murdered American Indian and Alaska Native women and girls across 71 US cities. More than 150 of the cases they found were not included in law enforcement records. Its authors determined that more than 95% of the cases in the report had not received coverage by a national or international news agencies. Dr Patty Loew, professor at Northwestern University’s journalism school and director of its Center for Native American and Indigenous Research, said the lack of coverage is driven by many factors, including the misclassification of Native women, the geographical separation between reservations and urban areas where news agencies are often based, and reporters naturally wanting to “stay within their cultural comfort zones”. “I think news prefers people that sort of stay within the system and people of color who are assimilatory and want equal rights – that’s something we understand,” said Loew, who is a member of the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Ojibwe. “But I think reporters don’t really understand sovereignty, and people who have a political identity that exists outside the mainstream.” Since the Petito case, many news agencies have suddenly jumped into reporting on missing Native American women and have highlighted the disparity, bringing attention to specific cases of missing Indigenous people. The effect, according to Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women USA, has been at least eight Indigenous women and girls being found. One had been missing for about a year. “It shows representation in the media matters,” said Deborah Maytubee Shipman, the organization’s director and founder. “We try so much to bend into what everybody wants to see instead of what we are. And for the first time I think we’re being recognized for what we actually are, a person of color and not some other fourth class.” On 15 September, Janice Enriquez, a member of the Dry Creek Rancheria Band of Pomo Indians, filed a missing person’s report for her 16-year-old daughter, Bluujaye Enriquez, in Sacramento, California. The teenager, who is biracial, Native and Hispanic, had been at her boyfriend’s home. Her parents did not want her to see him, Enriquez said. When her father came to get her, Bluujaye took off without her phone or money. Enriquez said after five days went by and she hadn’t heard from her daughter, and no detective had been assigned to the case, she tried calling the investigations division. She left a voicemail. She said she heard from a detective on 23 September, the day after a local news station aired a story about Bluujaye – following several failed attempts to get coverage from a handful of other local stations. “I didn’t feel like I had a police force on my team,” she said. “I felt like they just didn’t care. They shouldn’t look at it like, ‘oh another kid’; ‘oh there’s so many’. It doesn’t matter. We shouldn’t be missing any.” On 24 September, law enforcement told Enriquez that Bluujaye might be at a local youth shelter. But just a few days later, she had run away from the facility, according to Enriquez. “It’s sad when you’re looking for your child that there’s no help,” she said. “People will say there’s all this help, but there is no help to search for your kid.” Enriquez said she finally received a call from her daughter on 8 October on a blocked number. She said she’s fine, but Enriquez said she’s still very worried about the teenager’s safety. In response to questions about how the investigation was handled and why days went by before Enriquez heard from a detective, Sgt Sabrina Briggs, with the Sacramento police department, said in an email: “When the report was received officers began a follow-up investigation which included attempting to contact known associates, checking possible locations, contacting local hospitals and resource providers to develop leads. All preliminary investigative leads were exhausted and there were no signs of foul play.” In April, Deb Haaland, the first Indigenous cabinet secretary in US history, announced the formation of a new unit centered on investigating missing and murdered Native Americans. In a statement she described the violence against Indigenous people as a “crisis that has been underfunded for decades”, saying that about 1,500 American Indian and Alaska Native people across the country are listed as missing in the National Crime Information Center. Colfer explained that there are actually many more missing Indigenous people that are not reflected in official numbers, due to such things as reporting problems and misidentification. She said while she was hopeful Haaland’s work could help bring attention to missing Indigenous people, she believed it would take much more than one approach from a single federal agency. It will take more resources at the federal, state and tribal levels devoted to searching for missing Native people, more communication between law enforcement and these families, and also an expansion of tribal jurisdiction through the Violence Against Women’s Act, she said. “We need all of the federal government to communicate on this and really make this a priority,” she said. “And so, I’m hoping that we see success from that specific unit, but that we also see commitment to this issue from all areas.” Over the past several weeks, there have been a number of reported sightings of Charging Crow, including one by law enforcement. Police found her in a vehicle with a man in late September. Fast Horse said he is a registered sex offender. When the police told her to call her mother, she asked for her phone number, which Fast Horse said was very concerning given that her daughter long had it memorized. The family has heard from some in the community that Charging Crow is being held and used to transport drugs because she owes someone a debt. When one of Fast Horse’s other daughters was able to get into her Facebook and Twitter accounts, she found that every few days Charging Crow logs in from a different neighboring state. Last week, Fast Horse was in the hospital for dialysis treatment when she received a call from a number she didn’t recognize. It was Charging Crow. She was crying and told her she missed her, and her daughter, but throughout the 1 minute and 55 second call, Fast Horse said her daughter sounded stilted and she kept hearing someone whispering next to the phone. Fast Horse asked her when she was coming back. She said her daughter replied: “They said that I was gonna be able to go home in a couple of weeks … Now I’m not sure.” When Fast Horse relayed all of this to the detective, she said he asked her if she might be out doing drugs and partying. She said her daughter would have never done that. Fast Horse said having her daughter disappear has been extraordinarily painful. But feeling like she doesn’t have any help from law enforcement or the media has made it much worse. “As a Native woman, usually we don’t cry in front of people – that’s how I was taught because I’m older. We don’t usually show our emotions to a lot of people, you know you just keep going, you get up and you keep going,” she said. “But this thing with my daughter gone has brought me to my knees.”\n",
      "Monica Fast Horse texted her 26-year-old daughter on a Thursday evening in August to ask when she would be home. It wasn’t fear that drove her to it, it was simply what they always did: they checked in with each other. Fast Horse and her daughter Jenna Charging Crow lived together in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, along with another one of Fast Horse’s daughters and Charging Crow’s five-year-old daughter, Jenelle. Fast Horse, a member of the Oglala Lakota Tribe, helped raise her granddaughter, and Charging Crow served as primary caretaker for her mother as she dealt with the medical complications of end-stage kidney failure. Earlier in the week, the pair had been excitedly preparing outfits for Jenelle’s upcoming first day of kindergarten. Fast Horse said she remembered Charging Crow’s amazement that her daughter was going to be starting school in a matter of days, and was also looking toward her own first day at a new job at Wendy’s. That Thursday evening, Charging Crow went to her friend’s apartment, about a three-minute drive away. She was supposed to be out just a few hours, so all Charging Crow wore on her feet were slippers,, according to Fast Horse. But as the night went on, Fast Horse’s curiosity became concern. By the next day it had morphed into fear. “She would always, always check in with me,” Fast Horse told the Guardian. “I swear even in the past when we’ve had our differences and we’ve argued and stuff she would always call me or text me and say, ‘Mom, did you eat today?’ or ‘did you and baby eat today?’ or ‘how’s my baby doing?’” By the afternoon, Fast Horse said she called the Sioux Falls police department and filed a missing person’s report. About two hours later she said officers came to her home, took her statement and then went to the apartment complex her daughter had visited. For five agonizing days the family searched the area, covering stores and street poles with missing persons flyers and emailing and calling local news organizations before Fast Horse heard from the detective assigned to her daughter’s case. Her daughter has now been missing almost two months, and she has never heard back from any of the news organizations she contacted. “I never thought this would ever happen to me,” she said. “I’ve seen other posters, I’ve seen other notices, but I never thought it would happen to my kid. And going through this with the police department and people not helping you and not caring about you or not worrying about that.” Sgt Robert Forster with the Sioux Falls police department said he couldn’t speak directly to the case because it was an active investigation, but said that the detective on the case had been “working it diligently”. When asked about the amount of time that elapsed before Fast Horse was contacted, he explained that in some cases there may be a lag time because officers received an incorrect phone number for the family, or the detective was off for the weekend, or it came down to having to prioritize based on the day’s caseload. This year, he said, 10 detectives will be investigating as many as 800 cases, so “we have to prioritize those.” There has long been a devastating epidemic of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls in the US. Yet too often their cases receive little to no news media attention and their families can face doubts and delays from law enforcement agencies.

One had been missing for about a year. “It shows representation in the media matters,” said Deborah Maytubee Shipman, the organization’s director and founder. “We try so much to bend into what everybody wants to see instead of what we are. And for the first time I think we’re being recognized for what we actually are, a person of color and not some other fourth class.” On 15 September, Janice Enriquez, a member of the Dry Creek Rancheria Band of Pomo Indians, filed a missing person’s report for her 16-year-old daughter, Bluujaye Enriquez, in Sacramento, California. The teenager, who is biracial, Native and Hispanic, had been at her boyfriend’s home. Her parents did not want her to see him, Enriquez said. When her father came to get her, Bluujaye took off without her phone or money. Enriquez said after five days went by and she hadn’t heard from her daughter, and no detective had been assigned to the case, she tried calling the investigations division. She left a voicemail. She said she heard from a detective on 23 September, the day after a local news station aired a story about Bluujaye – following several failed attempts to get coverage from a handful of other local stations. “I didn’t feel like I had a police force on my team,” she said. “I felt like they just didn’t care. They shouldn’t look at it like, ‘oh another kid’; ‘oh there’s so many’. It doesn’t matter. We shouldn’t be missing any.” On 24 September, law enforcement told Enriquez that Bluujaye might be at a local youth shelter. But just a few days later, she had run away from the facility, according to Enriquez. “It’s sad when you’re looking for your child that there’s no help,” she said. “People will say there’s all this help, but there is no help to search for your kid.” Enriquez said she finally received a call from her daughter on 8 October on a blocked number. She said she’s fine, but Enriquez said she’s still very worried about the teenager’s safety. In response to questions about how the investigation was handled and why days went by before Enriquez heard from a detective, Sgt Sabrina Briggs, with the Sacramento police department, said in an email: “When the report was received officers began a follow-up investigation which included attempting to contact known associates, checking possible locations, contacting local hospitals and resource providers to develop leads. All preliminary investigative leads were exhausted and there were no signs of foul play.” In April, Deb Haaland, the first Indigenous cabinet secretary in US history, announced the formation of a new unit centered on investigating missing and murdered Native Americans. In a statement she described the violence against Indigenous people as a “crisis that has been underfunded for decades”, saying that about 1,500 American Indian and Alaska Native people across the country are listed as missing in the National Crime Information Center. Colfer explained that there are actually many more missing Indigenous people that are not reflected in official numbers, due to such things as reporting problems and misidentification. She said while she was hopeful Haaland’s work could help bring attention to missing Indigenous people, she believed it would take much more than one approach from a single federal agency. It will take more resources at the federal, state and tribal levels devoted to searching for missing Native people, more communication between law enforcement and these families, and also an expansion of tribal jurisdiction through the Violence Against Women’s Act, she said. “We need all of the federal government to communicate on this and really make this a priority,” she said. “And so, I’m hoping that we see success from that specific unit, but that we also see commitment to this issue from all areas.” Over the past several weeks, there have been a number of reported sightings of Charging Crow, including one by law enforcement. Police found her in a vehicle with a man in late September. Fast Horse said he is a registered sex offender. When the police told her to call her mother, she asked for her phone number, which Fast Horse said was very concerning given that her daughter long had it memorized. The family has heard from some in the community that Charging Crow is being held and used to transport drugs because she owes someone a debt. When one of Fast Horse’s other daughters was able to get into her Facebook and Twitter accounts, she found that every few days Charging Crow logs in from a different neighboring state. Last week, Fast Horse was in the hospital for dialysis treatment when she received a call from a number she didn’t recognize. It was Charging Crow. She was crying and told her she missed her, and her daughter, but throughout the 1 minute and 55 second call, Fast Horse said her daughter sounded stilted and she kept hearing someone whispering next to the phone. Fast Horse asked her when she was coming back. She said her daughter replied: “They said that I was gonna be able to go home in a couple of weeks … Now I’m not sure.” When Fast Horse relayed all of this to the detective, she said he asked her if she might be out doing drugs and partying. She said her daughter would have never done that. Fast Horse said having her daughter disappear has been extraordinarily painful. But feeling like she doesn’t have any help from law enforcement or the media has made it much worse. “As a Native woman, usually we don’t cry in front of people – that’s how I was taught because I’m older. We don’t usually show our emotions to a lot of people, you know you just keep going, you get up and you keep going,” she said. “But this thing with my daughter gone has brought me to my knees.”\n",
      "Monica Fast Horse texted her 26-year-old daughter on a Thursday evening in August to ask when she would be home. It wasn’t fear that drove her to it, it was simply what they always did: they checked in with each other. Fast Horse and her daughter Jenna Charging Crow lived together in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, along with another one of Fast Horse’s daughters and Charging Crow’s five-year-old daughter, Jenelle. Fast Horse, a member of the Oglala Lakota Tribe, helped raise her granddaughter, and Charging Crow served as primary caretaker for her mother as she dealt with the medical complications of end-stage kidney failure. Earlier in the week, the pair had been excitedly preparing outfits for Jenelle’s upcoming first day of kindergarten. Fast Horse said she remembered Charging Crow’s amazement that her daughter was going to be starting school in a matter of days, and was also looking toward her own first day at a new job at Wendy’s. That Thursday evening, Charging Crow went to her friend’s apartment, about a three-minute drive away. She was supposed to be out just a few hours, so all Charging Crow wore on her feet were slippers,, according to Fast Horse. But as the night went on, Fast Horse’s curiosity became concern. By the next day it had morphed into fear. “She would always, always check in with me,” Fast Horse told the Guardian. “I swear even in the past when we’ve had our differences and we’ve argued and stuff she would always call me or text me and say, ‘Mom, did you eat today?’ or ‘did you and baby eat today?’ or ‘how’s my baby doing?’” By the afternoon, Fast Horse said she called the Sioux Falls police department and filed a missing person’s report. About two hours later she said officers came to her home, took her statement and then went to the apartment complex her daughter had visited. For five agonizing days the family searched the area, covering stores and street poles with missing persons flyers and emailing and calling local news organizations before Fast Horse heard from the detective assigned to her daughter’s case. Her daughter has now been missing almost two months, and she has never heard back from any of the news organizations she contacted. “I never thought this would ever happen to me,” she said. “I’ve seen other posters, I’ve seen other notices, but I never thought it would happen to my kid. And going through this with the police department and people not helping you and not caring about you or not worrying about that.” Sgt Robert Forster with the Sioux Falls police department said he couldn’t speak directly to the case because it was an active investigation, but said that the detective on the case had been “working it diligently”. When asked about the amount of time that elapsed before Fast Horse was contacted, he explained that in some cases there may be a lag time because officers received an incorrect phone number for the family, or the detective was off for the weekend, or it came down to having to prioritize based on the day’s caseload. This year, he said, 10 detectives will be investigating as many as 800 cases, so “we have to prioritize those.” There has long been a devastating epidemic of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls in the US. Yet too often their cases receive little to no news media attention and their families can face doubts and delays from law enforcement agencies. The tragic case of Gabby Petito, whose body was discovered late last month in a national park in Wyoming after a rapid-fire law enforcement response and national news media frenzy, only served to emphasize the disparity that often exists when a white woman is missing compared with when an Indigenous woman is reported missing. Although Petito’s and Charging Crow’s cases are very much distinct, and each is heart-wrenching in its own way, Petito’s family has received some tragic answers about what happened to her. Fast Horse and her family’s desperate search continues. Kerri Colfer, who is Tlingit and the National Indigenous Women’s Resource Center’s senior native affairs adviser, said she had noticed many instances where law enforcement officers have victim-blamed Native women and been slow to investigate or declare them missing. “That often means that the families end up leading the searches for their missing relatives, before law enforcement even tries to get involved,” she said. “And obviously, that is retraumatizing for families.” In 2018, the Urban Indian Health Institute released a report documenting hundreds of cases of missing and murdered American Indian and Alaska Native women and girls across 71 US cities. More than 150 of the cases they found were not included in law enforcement records. Its authors determined that more than 95% of the cases in the report had not received coverage by a national or international news agencies. Dr Patty Loew, professor at Northwestern University’s journalism school and director of its Center for Native American and Indigenous Research, said the lack of coverage is driven by many factors, including the misclassification of Native women, the geographical separation between reservations and urban areas where news agencies are often based, and reporters naturally wanting to “stay within their cultural comfort zones”. “I think news prefers people that sort of stay within the system and people of color who are assimilatory and want equal rights – that’s something we understand,” said Loew, who is a member of the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Ojibwe. “But I think reporters don’t really understand sovereignty, and people who have a political identity that exists outside the mainstream.” Since the Petito case, many news agencies have suddenly jumped into reporting on missing Native American women and have highlighted the disparity, bringing attention to specific cases of missing Indigenous people.

We shouldn’t be missing any.” On 24 September, law enforcement told Enriquez that Bluujaye might be at a local youth shelter. But just a few days later, she had run away from the facility, according to Enriquez. “It’s sad when you’re looking for your child that there’s no help,” she said. “People will say there’s all this help, but there is no help to search for your kid.” Enriquez said she finally received a call from her daughter on 8 October on a blocked number. She said she’s fine, but Enriquez said she’s still very worried about the teenager’s safety. In response to questions about how the investigation was handled and why days went by before Enriquez heard from a detective, Sgt Sabrina Briggs, with the Sacramento police department, said in an email: “When the report was received officers began a follow-up investigation which included attempting to contact known associates, checking possible locations, contacting local hospitals and resource providers to develop leads. All preliminary investigative leads were exhausted and there were no signs of foul play.” In April, Deb Haaland, the first Indigenous cabinet secretary in US history, announced the formation of a new unit centered on investigating missing and murdered Native Americans. In a statement she described the violence against Indigenous people as a “crisis that has been underfunded for decades”, saying that about 1,500 American Indian and Alaska Native people across the country are listed as missing in the National Crime Information Center. Colfer explained that there are actually many more missing Indigenous people that are not reflected in official numbers, due to such things as reporting problems and misidentification. She said while she was hopeful Haaland’s work could help bring attention to missing Indigenous people, she believed it would take much more than one approach from a single federal agency. It will take more resources at the federal, state and tribal levels devoted to searching for missing Native people, more communication between law enforcement and these families, and also an expansion of tribal jurisdiction through the Violence Against Women’s Act, she said. “We need all of the federal government to communicate on this and really make this a priority,” she said. “And so, I’m hoping that we see success from that specific unit, but that we also see commitment to this issue from all areas.” Over the past several weeks, there have been a number of reported sightings of Charging Crow, including one by law enforcement. Police found her in a vehicle with a man in late September. Fast Horse said he is a registered sex offender. When the police told her to call her mother, she asked for her phone number, which Fast Horse said was very concerning given that her daughter long had it memorized. The family has heard from some in the community that Charging Crow is being held and used to transport drugs because she owes someone a debt. When one of Fast Horse’s other daughters was able to get into her Facebook and Twitter accounts, she found that every few days Charging Crow logs in from a different neighboring state. Last week, Fast Horse was in the hospital for dialysis treatment when she received a call from a number she didn’t recognize. It was Charging Crow. She was crying and told her she missed her, and her daughter, but throughout the 1 minute and 55 second call, Fast Horse said her daughter sounded stilted and she kept hearing someone whispering next to the phone. Fast Horse asked her when she was coming back. She said her daughter replied: “They said that I was gonna be able to go home in a couple of weeks … Now I’m not sure.” When Fast Horse relayed all of this to the detective, she said he asked her if she might be out doing drugs and partying. She said her daughter would have never done that. Fast Horse said having her daughter disappear has been extraordinarily painful. But feeling like she doesn’t have any help from law enforcement or the media has made it much worse. “As a Native woman, usually we don’t cry in front of people – that’s how I was taught because I’m older. We don’t usually show our emotions to a lot of people, you know you just keep going, you get up and you keep going,” she said. “But this thing with my daughter gone has brought me to my knees.”\n",
      "Monica Fast Horse texted her 26-year-old daughter on a Thursday evening in August to ask when she would be home. It wasn’t fear that drove her to it, it was simply what they always did: they checked in with each other. Fast Horse and her daughter Jenna Charging Crow lived together in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, along with another one of Fast Horse’s daughters and Charging Crow’s five-year-old daughter, Jenelle. Fast Horse, a member of the Oglala Lakota Tribe, helped raise her granddaughter, and Charging Crow served as primary caretaker for her mother as she dealt with the medical complications of end-stage kidney failure. Earlier in the week, the pair had been excitedly preparing outfits for Jenelle’s upcoming first day of kindergarten. Fast Horse said she remembered Charging Crow’s amazement that her daughter was going to be starting school in a matter of days, and was also looking toward her own first day at a new job at Wendy’s. That Thursday evening, Charging Crow went to her friend’s apartment, about a three-minute drive away. She was supposed to be out just a few hours, so all Charging Crow wore on her feet were slippers,, according to Fast Horse. But as the night went on, Fast Horse’s curiosity became concern. By the next day it had morphed into fear. “She would always, always check in with me,” Fast Horse told the Guardian. “I swear even in the past when we’ve had our differences and we’ve argued and stuff she would always call me or text me and say, ‘Mom, did you eat today?’ or ‘did you and baby eat today?’ or ‘how’s my baby doing?’” By the afternoon, Fast Horse said she called the Sioux Falls police department and filed a missing person’s report. About two hours later she said officers came to her home, took her statement and then went to the apartment complex her daughter had visited. For five agonizing days the family searched the area, covering stores and street poles with missing persons flyers and emailing and calling local news organizations before Fast Horse heard from the detective assigned to her daughter’s case. Her daughter has now been missing almost two months, and she has never heard back from any of the news organizations she contacted. “I never thought this would ever happen to me,” she said. “I’ve seen other posters, I’ve seen other notices, but I never thought it would happen to my kid. And going through this with the police department and people not helping you and not caring about you or not worrying about that.” Sgt Robert Forster with the Sioux Falls police department said he couldn’t speak directly to the case because it was an active investigation, but said that the detective on the case had been “working it diligently”. When asked about the amount of time that elapsed before Fast Horse was contacted, he explained that in some cases there may be a lag time because officers received an incorrect phone number for the family, or the detective was off for the weekend, or it came down to having to prioritize based on the day’s caseload. This year, he said, 10 detectives will be investigating as many as 800 cases, so “we have to prioritize those.” There has long been a devastating epidemic of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls in the US. Yet too often their cases receive little to no news media attention and their families can face doubts and delays from law enforcement agencies. The tragic case of Gabby Petito, whose body was discovered late last month in a national park in Wyoming after a rapid-fire law enforcement response and national news media frenzy, only served to emphasize the disparity that often exists when a white woman is missing compared with when an Indigenous woman is reported missing. Although Petito’s and Charging Crow’s cases are very much distinct, and each is heart-wrenching in its own way, Petito’s family has received some tragic answers about what happened to her. Fast Horse and her family’s desperate search continues. Kerri Colfer, who is Tlingit and the National Indigenous Women’s Resource Center’s senior native affairs adviser, said she had noticed many instances where law enforcement officers have victim-blamed Native women and been slow to investigate or declare them missing. “That often means that the families end up leading the searches for their missing relatives, before law enforcement even tries to get involved,” she said. “And obviously, that is retraumatizing for families.” In 2018, the Urban Indian Health Institute released a report documenting hundreds of cases of missing and murdered American Indian and Alaska Native women and girls across 71 US cities. More than 150 of the cases they found were not included in law enforcement records. Its authors determined that more than 95% of the cases in the report had not received coverage by a national or international news agencies. Dr Patty Loew, professor at Northwestern University’s journalism school and director of its Center for Native American and Indigenous Research, said the lack of coverage is driven by many factors, including the misclassification of Native women, the geographical separation between reservations and urban areas where news agencies are often based, and reporters naturally wanting to “stay within their cultural comfort zones”. “I think news prefers people that sort of stay within the system and people of color who are assimilatory and want equal rights – that’s something we understand,” said Loew, who is a member of the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Ojibwe. “But I think reporters don’t really understand sovereignty, and people who have a political identity that exists outside the mainstream.” Since the Petito case, many news agencies have suddenly jumped into reporting on missing Native American women and have highlighted the disparity, bringing attention to specific cases of missing Indigenous people. The effect, according to Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women USA, has been at least eight Indigenous women and girls being found. One had been missing for about a year. “It shows representation in the media matters,” said Deborah Maytubee Shipman, the organization’s director and founder. “We try so much to bend into what everybody wants to see instead of what we are. And for the first time I think we’re being recognized for what we actually are, a person of color and not some other fourth class.” On 15 September, Janice Enriquez, a member of the Dry Creek Rancheria Band of Pomo Indians, filed a missing person’s report for her 16-year-old daughter, Bluujaye Enriquez, in Sacramento, California. The teenager, who is biracial, Native and Hispanic, had been at her boyfriend’s home. Her parents did not want her to see him, Enriquez said. When her father came to get her, Bluujaye took off without her phone or money. Enriquez said after five days went by and she hadn’t heard from her daughter, and no detective had been assigned to the case, she tried calling the investigations division. She left a voicemail. She said she heard from a detective on 23 September, the day after a local news station aired a story about Bluujaye – following several failed attempts to get coverage from a handful of other local stations. “I didn’t feel like I had a police force on my team,” she said. “I felt like they just didn’t care.

It will take more resources at the federal, state and tribal levels devoted to searching for missing Native people, more communication between law enforcement and these families, and also an expansion of tribal jurisdiction through the Violence Against Women’s Act, she said. “We need all of the federal government to communicate on this and really make this a priority,” she said. “And so, I’m hoping that we see success from that specific unit, but that we also see commitment to this issue from all areas.” Over the past several weeks, there have been a number of reported sightings of Charging Crow, including one by law enforcement. Police found her in a vehicle with a man in late September. Fast Horse said he is a registered sex offender. When the police told her to call her mother, she asked for her phone number, which Fast Horse said was very concerning given that her daughter long had it memorized. The family has heard from some in the community that Charging Crow is being held and used to transport drugs because she owes someone a debt. When one of Fast Horse’s other daughters was able to get into her Facebook and Twitter accounts, she found that every few days Charging Crow logs in from a different neighboring state. Last week, Fast Horse was in the hospital for dialysis treatment when she received a call from a number she didn’t recognize. It was Charging Crow. She was crying and told her she missed her, and her daughter, but throughout the 1 minute and 55 second call, Fast Horse said her daughter sounded stilted and she kept hearing someone whispering next to the phone. Fast Horse asked her when she was coming back. She said her daughter replied: “They said that I was gonna be able to go home in a couple of weeks … Now I’m not sure.” When Fast Horse relayed all of this to the detective, she said he asked her if she might be out doing drugs and partying. She said her daughter would have never done that. Fast Horse said having her daughter disappear has been extraordinarily painful. But feeling like she doesn’t have any help from law enforcement or the media has made it much worse. “As a Native woman, usually we don’t cry in front of people – that’s how I was taught because I’m older. We don’t usually show our emotions to a lot of people, you know you just keep going, you get up and you keep going,” she said. “But this thing with my daughter gone has brought me to my knees.”\n",
      "Monica Fast Horse texted her 26-year-old daughter on a Thursday evening in August to ask when she would be home. It wasn’t fear that drove her to it, it was simply what they always did: they checked in with each other. Fast Horse and her daughter Jenna Charging Crow lived together in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, along with another one of Fast Horse’s daughters and Charging Crow’s five-year-old daughter, Jenelle. Fast Horse, a member of the Oglala Lakota Tribe, helped raise her granddaughter, and Charging Crow served as primary caretaker for her mother as she dealt with the medical complications of end-stage kidney failure. Earlier in the week, the pair had been excitedly preparing outfits for Jenelle’s upcoming first day of kindergarten. Fast Horse said she remembered Charging Crow’s amazement that her daughter was going to be starting school in a matter of days, and was also looking toward her own first day at a new job at Wendy’s. That Thursday evening, Charging Crow went to her friend’s apartment, about a three-minute drive away. She was supposed to be out just a few hours, so all Charging Crow wore on her feet were slippers,, according to Fast Horse. But as the night went on, Fast Horse’s curiosity became concern. By the next day it had morphed into fear. “She would always, always check in with me,” Fast Horse told the Guardian. “I swear even in the past when we’ve had our differences and we’ve argued and stuff she would always call me or text me and say, ‘Mom, did you eat today?’ or ‘did you and baby eat today?’ or ‘how’s my baby doing?’” By the afternoon, Fast Horse said she called the Sioux Falls police department and filed a missing person’s report. About two hours later she said officers came to her home, took her statement and then went to the apartment complex her daughter had visited. For five agonizing days the family searched the area, covering stores and street poles with missing persons flyers and emailing and calling local news organizations before Fast Horse heard from the detective assigned to her daughter’s case. Her daughter has now been missing almost two months, and she has never heard back from any of the news organizations she contacted. “I never thought this would ever happen to me,” she said. “I’ve seen other posters, I’ve seen other notices, but I never thought it would happen to my kid. And going through this with the police department and people not helping you and not caring about you or not worrying about that.” Sgt Robert Forster with the Sioux Falls police department said he couldn’t speak directly to the case because it was an active investigation, but said that the detective on the case had been “working it diligently”. When asked about the amount of time that elapsed before Fast Horse was contacted, he explained that in some cases there may be a lag time because officers received an incorrect phone number for the family, or the detective was off for the weekend, or it came down to having to prioritize based on the day’s caseload. This year, he said, 10 detectives will be investigating as many as 800 cases, so “we have to prioritize those.” There has long been a devastating epidemic of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls in the US. Yet too often their cases receive little to no news media attention and their families can face doubts and delays from law enforcement agencies. The tragic case of Gabby Petito, whose body was discovered late last month in a national park in Wyoming after a rapid-fire law enforcement response and national news media frenzy, only served to emphasize the disparity that often exists when a white woman is missing compared with when an Indigenous woman is reported missing. Although Petito’s and Charging Crow’s cases are very much distinct, and each is heart-wrenching in its own way, Petito’s family has received some tragic answers about what happened to her. Fast Horse and her family’s desperate search continues. Kerri Colfer, who is Tlingit and the National Indigenous Women’s Resource Center’s senior native affairs adviser, said she had noticed many instances where law enforcement officers have victim-blamed Native women and been slow to investigate or declare them missing. “That often means that the families end up leading the searches for their missing relatives, before law enforcement even tries to get involved,” she said. “And obviously, that is retraumatizing for families.” In 2018, the Urban Indian Health Institute released a report documenting hundreds of cases of missing and murdered American Indian and Alaska Native women and girls across 71 US cities. More than 150 of the cases they found were not included in law enforcement records. Its authors determined that more than 95% of the cases in the report had not received coverage by a national or international news agencies. Dr Patty Loew, professor at Northwestern University’s journalism school and director of its Center for Native American and Indigenous Research, said the lack of coverage is driven by many factors, including the misclassification of Native women, the geographical separation between reservations and urban areas where news agencies are often based, and reporters naturally wanting to “stay within their cultural comfort zones”. “I think news prefers people that sort of stay within the system and people of color who are assimilatory and want equal rights – that’s something we understand,” said Loew, who is a member of the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Ojibwe. “But I think reporters don’t really understand sovereignty, and people who have a political identity that exists outside the mainstream.” Since the Petito case, many news agencies have suddenly jumped into reporting on missing Native American women and have highlighted the disparity, bringing attention to specific cases of missing Indigenous people. The effect, according to Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women USA, has been at least eight Indigenous women and girls being found. One had been missing for about a year. “It shows representation in the media matters,” said Deborah Maytubee Shipman, the organization’s director and founder. “We try so much to bend into what everybody wants to see instead of what we are. And for the first time I think we’re being recognized for what we actually are, a person of color and not some other fourth class.” On 15 September, Janice Enriquez, a member of the Dry Creek Rancheria Band of Pomo Indians, filed a missing person’s report for her 16-year-old daughter, Bluujaye Enriquez, in Sacramento, California. The teenager, who is biracial, Native and Hispanic, had been at her boyfriend’s home. Her parents did not want her to see him, Enriquez said. When her father came to get her, Bluujaye took off without her phone or money. Enriquez said after five days went by and she hadn’t heard from her daughter, and no detective had been assigned to the case, she tried calling the investigations division. She left a voicemail. She said she heard from a detective on 23 September, the day after a local news station aired a story about Bluujaye – following several failed attempts to get coverage from a handful of other local stations. “I didn’t feel like I had a police force on my team,” she said. “I felt like they just didn’t care. They shouldn’t look at it like, ‘oh another kid’; ‘oh there’s so many’. It doesn’t matter. We shouldn’t be missing any.” On 24 September, law enforcement told Enriquez that Bluujaye might be at a local youth shelter. But just a few days later, she had run away from the facility, according to Enriquez. “It’s sad when you’re looking for your child that there’s no help,” she said. “People will say there’s all this help, but there is no help to search for your kid.” Enriquez said she finally received a call from her daughter on 8 October on a blocked number. She said she’s fine, but Enriquez said she’s still very worried about the teenager’s safety. In response to questions about how the investigation was handled and why days went by before Enriquez heard from a detective, Sgt Sabrina Briggs, with the Sacramento police department, said in an email: “When the report was received officers began a follow-up investigation which included attempting to contact known associates, checking possible locations, contacting local hospitals and resource providers to develop leads. All preliminary investigative leads were exhausted and there were no signs of foul play.” In April, Deb Haaland, the first Indigenous cabinet secretary in US history, announced the formation of a new unit centered on investigating missing and murdered Native Americans. In a statement she described the violence against Indigenous people as a “crisis that has been underfunded for decades”, saying that about 1,500 American Indian and Alaska Native people across the country are listed as missing in the National Crime Information Center. Colfer explained that there are actually many more missing Indigenous people that are not reflected in official numbers, due to such things as reporting problems and misidentification. She said while she was hopeful Haaland’s work could help bring attention to missing Indigenous people, she believed it would take much more than one approach from a single federal agency. It will take more resources at the federal, state and tribal levels devoted to searching for missing Native people, more communication between law enforcement and these families, and also an expansion of tribal jurisdiction through the Violence Against Women’s Act, she said. “We need all of the federal government to communicate on this and really make this a priority,” she said. “And so, I’m hoping that we see success from that specific unit, but that we also see commitment to this issue from all areas.” Over the past several weeks, there have been a number of reported sightings of Charging Crow, including one by law enforcement.

      "Matt Hancock, the former UK health secretary, will no longer become a special envoy for the United Nations, after the job offer was withdrawn. Hancock said on Tuesday he was “honoured” to be working with the UN’s economic commission for Africa (Uneca) to help the continent recover from the pandemic. However, campaigners objected to the appointment because of his record in government during the coronavirus crisis, and on Friday the UN’s official spokesperson said the appointment would not be taken forward. The Uneca has since removed the press release from its website announcing Hancock’s appointment to the unpaid role. Hancock claimed on Saturday that the offer had been withdrawn because of a technicality. In a statement, he said: “The UN have written to me to explain that a technical UN rule has subsequently come to light which states that sitting members of parliament cannot also be UN special representatives. “Since I am committed to continuing to serve as MP for West Suffolk, this means I cannot take up the position.” However, there are previous instances of sitting MPs taking up UN posts: former prime minister Gordon Brown was appointed as a special envoy in 2012. The Uneca had lavished praise on Hancock’s abilities, saying it had asked him to take on the role because of his “economic policy expertise, experience operating financial markets at the Bank of England and in-depth understanding of government and multilateral through his various ministerial cabinet roles”. The release quoted the commission’s under secretary general, Vera Songwe, saying: “We are confident that his expertise and leadership will offer immediate and long-term impact particularly in effecting long-term financial growth.” Hancock was also quoted in the Uneca release as saying he was “thrilled” to be joining the organisation, adding: “I care deeply about making this happen not only because of the strong economic opportunity but because we share a view of Africa as a strategic long-term partner.” The withdrawal of the offer will come as a blow to Hancock’s efforts to rebuild his career after resigning as health secretary in June, following revelations that he had been having an affair with his parliamentary aide during lockdown. Songwe is said to have appointed Hancock after Nimco Ali, a Home Office adviser on violence against women, introduced her to the MP. Hancock spoke at a fringe event at the Conservative party conference this month, saying he wanted to help bring private investment to Africa. The announcement of his new role was greeted with support from senior Conservatives including Michael Gove, Sajid Javid and Damian Green. However, NGOs and activists objected to the appointment, which was announced on the same day that MPs published a report saying thousands of people had died because the government had failed to lock down early enough, while Hancock was health secretary. Global Justice Now said in a tweet: “Matt Hancock blocked international efforts to allow low- and middle-income countries to produce their own Covid-19 vaccines, leading to millions of global south deaths. The audacity of this man claiming to help African nations and promote sustainable development is sickening.” The UN secretary general’s official spokesperson, Stéphane Dujarric, said: “Mr Hancock’s appointment by the UN economic commission for Africa is not being taken forward. ECA has advised him of the matter.” UN sources indicated that rules on conflicts of interest had been a factor in secretary general António Guterres’s decision to withdraw the offer.\n",
      "Confidential documents leaked to the Observer reveal an extraordinary rift between Boris Johnson and his chancellor, Rishi Sunak, over the potential economic effects of moving towards a zero-carbon economy, with just weeks to go before the crucial Cop26 climate summit. As Johnson prepares to position the UK at the head of global efforts to combat climate change and curb greenhouse gas emissions as host of the Glasgow Cop26 meeting, the documents show the Treasury is warning of serious economic damage to the UK economy and future tax rises if the UK overspends on, or misdirects, green investment. Green experts said the “half-baked” and “one-sided” Treasury net-zero review presented only the costs of action on emissions, rather than the benefits, such as green jobs, lower energy bills and avoiding the disastrous impact of global heating. They said the review could be “weaponised” by climate-change deniers around the world before Cop26, undermining Johnson’s attempts at climate leadership on the global stage. The internal Treasury documents say that while there may be economic benefits to UK companies from swift and appropriate climate action, there is also a danger that economic activity could move abroad if firms found their costs were increasing by more than those of their overseas competitors. The leaked papers are understood to have been produced to accompany a slide show given confidentially to key groups outside government in the last month. The documents state: “The investment required to decarbonise the UK economy is uncertain but could help to improve the UK’s relatively low investment levels and increase productivity. “However, more green investment is likely to attract diminishing returns, reducing the positive impact of ever more investment on GDP. Some green investments could displace other, more productive, investment opportunities. If more productive investments are made earlier in the transition, this risk may be accentuated later in the transition.” On the risk of additional costs to companies from green initiatives, the documents say: “Climate action in the UK can lead to economic activity moving abroad if it directly leads to costs increasing, and it is more profitable to produce in countries with less stringent climate policies.” On the fiscal implications, the documents say the cost of moving towards net zero could mean tax rises because of “the erosion of tax revenue from fossil fuel-related activity”. They say: “The government may need to consider changes to existing taxes and new sources of revenue throughout the transition in order to deliver net zero sustainably, and consistently with the government’s fiscal principles.” Ed Matthew, campaign director at the E3G thinktank, said: “To governments looking to Cop26, this looks unprofessional and embarrassing. The UK is standing in front of the world at Cop26 trying to galvanise ambitious action from every country. If the government has not presented the robust economic case in favour of action, that’s going to significantly undermine those attempts.” The Treasury’s approach is also starkly at odds with that of business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng and the analysis of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) in a report published in July this year. On the costs of moving towards net zero, the OBR said in its report: “Between now and 2050 the fiscal costs of getting to net zero in the UK could be significant, but they are not exceptional ... While unmitigated climate change would spell disaster, the net fiscal costs of moving to net zero emissions by 2050 could be comparatively modest.” The Committee on Climate Change, the government’s statutory adviser, has also repeatedly said the costs of action are small and diminishing, at less than 1% of GDP by 2050, while the costs of inaction are large and rising. While there are concerns over how the costs could fall on poorer households, the CCC chief executive Chris Stark has made clear that ministers can choose to distribute the costs and benefits fairly, through the design of green policies. Whitehall sources said there was a belief that Sunak was keen to position himself as something of a climate-change sceptic in order to boost his popularity with Tory party members, and draw comparisons with Johnson’s green enthusiasms. “Rishi clearly sees an interest in showing he is not really down with this green stuff. He wants Boris to own the whole agenda.” A source at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy confirmed that the Treasury was “kicking back” against many of the green plans being advanced by No 10 and Kwarteng. “They are not climate change deniers but they are emphasising the short-term risks, rather than long-term needs, which is what we are emphasising.” In contrast to the Treasury’s caution, Labour committed at its recent party conference to invest £28bn extra every year until 2030 to secure a “green transition” creating good jobs with decent wages in the process. The leak comes as the government prepares to publish its long-awaited net zero strategy, and heat and buildings strategy, which will contain policies on cutting emissions and creating green jobs, including a ban on new gas boilers from 2035 and grants for householders to move to green heating. The government’s Cop26 president, former business secretary Alok Sharma, is embarking on a frantic last-ditch round of diplomacy, including with Chinese representatives, amid speculation that President Xi Jinping will not attend the talks. The US and the EU are also talking to key high-emitting countries in the final weeks before Cop26, which opens on 31 October. The Treasury said: “The government is committed to tackling climate change and the prime minister has set out an ambitious 10-point plan to help us achieve that. The Treasury is playing a crucial role in this effort, by allocating £12bn to fund the plan, setting up the UK infrastructure bank to invest in net zero, and committing to raise £15bn for projects like zero-emissions buses, offshore wind and schemes to decarbonise homes.”\n",

      "A man has been charged with sexual offences after allegedly kidnapping a teenage girl while impersonating a police officer. David Peter Young, 32, a chef from Ifield, is due to appear at Brighton magistrates court on Saturday. Young is charged with kidnap with intent to commit a sexual offence, kidnap, impersonating a police officer and two breaches of a sexual harm prevention order over the incident, which allegedly happened on Wednesday morning. According to Sussex police, a 14-year-old girl was approached on her way to school in the Three Bridges area in Crawley, West Sussex, by a man wearing a yellow hi-vis jacket. He took her to a nearby area away from the road and searched her clothing, before leaving the scene on a bicycle. The girl was unharmed and is receiving support. Since Wayne Couzens, a serving Metropolitan police officer, used police powers and equipment in his kidnap, rape and murder of Sarah Everard, there have been concerns over women being approached by lone policemen. Sussex police superintendent Marc Clothier said there would be more uniformed patrols in the area in the incident’s aftermath, and he encouraged members of the public to speak to officers. He added: “We understand some people may want additional reassurance when interacting with a lone police officer and when you are alone. “If this is the case, genuine officers can use their police radio on loud speaker to talk to the operator in the police control room. The operator can confirm the identity of the officer, that they are on duty and carrying out legitimate policing business. “You can also ask a passerby to observe. Off-duty officers intervening in a crime in action or where someone is vulnerable, and not carrying a radio, will quickly call 999 for backup.”\n",

      "Robert Durst, the wealthy New York real estate heir and convicted murderer, is on a ventilator after testing positive for Covid-19, his attorney has confirmed to the Los Angeles Times. Durst’s attorney Dick DeGuerin told the newspaper his client was in “very bad condition” during the sentencing hearing and “was having difficulty breathing and he was having difficulty communicating”. DeGuerin confirmed to the Times that Durst had been hospitalized and placed on a ventilator in a wing of USC medical center under the watch of the Los Angeles county sheriff’s department where he has been through out his recent murder trial. The announcement of a Covid-19 infection comes two days after Durst, 78, was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of Susan Berman in 2000, a slaying possibly tied to the 1982 disappearance Durst’s wife, Kathie McCormack Durst. Durst appeared frail and at times confused at trial. His lawyers said at Thursday’s sentencing they plan to appeal his conviction. The latest development in the Durst story comes a month after a Los Angeles jury convicted Durst of first-degree murder in the 2000 killing. At trial, prosecutors argued that Durst had shot Berman at point-blank range in her home to prevent her from telling police what she knew about the disappearance of Durst’s wife, whose body has never been found. Six years ago, a Netflix documentary series The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst brought new public attention to the accusations against Durst. He was arrested on the eve of the airing of the last episode, in which Durst appeared to confess to the killings, saying to himself, “What the hell did I do? … Killed them all, of course.” The Berman case verdict was the first homicide conviction for Durst, who has also been linked to the death of neighbor Morris Black, whose body parts were found In Galveston Bay, Texas. Durst had fled to Texas after Berman’s killing and lived under an assumed name, Dorothy Ciner, and regularly wore a woman’s wig, dresses and high heels. Claiming self-defense, Durst was acquitted of Black’s murder in 2001, despite admitting to dismembering his body.\n",
      "It is one of the conundrums of the current phase of the Covid pandemic: the UK has among the highest number of infections across the world and a death toll that continues to steadily climb, yet the national mood seems sanguine. So is this down to British stoicism, a Keep Calm and Carry on mentality? Not according to experts. They talk of many factors being at play – and warn it may not last. “We’re in a phase where we still have large numbers of people dying from this disease,” said Linda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh. “But it has gone into the background. We’ve become used to something that has not gone away. I think there’s been a desensitisation to the mortality.” On Thursday, the UK reported more than 45,000 new coronavirus cases – the most since mid-July – and more than 800 deaths were reported in the past seven days. Hospitalisations are rising, with one-fifth of ICU beds occupied by Covid patients, and the latest figures showed an estimated 200,000 pupils absent from school. The UK is faring far worse than its European neighbours, with a rate of deaths per million people nearly triple those seen in France, Germany and Italy. However, the figures are still better than some predictions; Sage scientists said October could see  7,000 hospitalisations a day  In any case, it is not all about the statistics. “When the Covid announcements were made, they’d say ‘Very sadly, three people have died’, then it was ‘Very sadly 70 have died’,” said Prof Robert West, a behavioural scientist at University College London. “Now they don’t say ‘Very sadly’. One thing we know about humans is our emotions are stirred by images, they’re not stirred by numbers.” Bauld believes current attitudes have been shaped by the “Freedom Day narrative” – the social contract made between the government and the public that if people came forward for vaccines, life would return to normal. “A lot of people have bought into that,” she said. This includes some scientists. “There’s some who are of the view that Covid is becoming endemic, it was always going to become endemic and we just need to get on with it,” said Bauld. “Then we’ve got another group of scientists saying ‘Look around the world at other countries that won’t tolerate such high rates of infection, and what about long Covid?’” Growing division in the community means that scientists are no longer providing a coherent argument – and to some extent the government can pick and choose which views it amplifies. Is there something particular to the British psyche – a stiff upper lip, an internalising of angst – that makes the country appear relatively unshaken by the ongoing toll of the pandemic? “There definitely isn’t,” said West. “The British are much more safety conscious than most other countries when you look at driving, health and safety at work, the way we approach public health. “This is something that is conditioned by the norms we see around us. When our leaders talk about Covid in the past tense, it gets through to people.” As a disease shifts from an initial pandemic phase to an endemic illness, the data curves outlining its spread become less precipitous. And psychologists say this steady stream of daily deaths – although the UK is now on an upwards trajectory – tends to feel less alarming than the rises we witnessed in the first year of the pandemic. “We’re built to react to change. We don’t react to steady state,” said West. “Something will have to change in people’s psyche to make people feel like we need to do more about it.” This may have been reflected in the health secretary’s apparent lack of concern when asked on Thursday about the continuing high rates of infection. “Overall things feel quite stable at this point. The numbers are a bit up, a bit down over the last few weeks,” Sajid Javid told Times Radio.  According to West, accepting steady state is a question of framing. “There are steady states that appear troubling for humans,” he said. “By virtue of the fact that’s it going to go on and on … the public may start saying: ‘We can’t keep having 1,000 deaths a week.’” A possible trigger for such a reappraisal may be the continued strain on the NHS. Hospitals may not be “overwhelmed”but figures released this week showed that 5.7 million people were on waiting lists at the end of August, the highest figure since records began in 2007. “We’re not back to normal, it’s as simple as that,” said Prof Tim Cook, a consultant in anaesthesia and intensive care medicine. With about 20% of ICU beds and 10% of hospital beds occupied by Covid patients, there is no prospect of an imminent return to business as usual. “That proportion will continue to slowly occupy hospital beds for many weeks or months to come,” Cook said. “I don’t see an end to this level of occupancy for quite some time. However, there is disagreement even among health professionals about what an acceptable “steady state” would be for Covid. “Some still support a zero Covid model, with an aim of having no cases, while others are accepting of the current situation, in which we have about 40,000 cases,” said Andrew Goddard, president of the Royal College of Physicians. “We have all accepted – doctors included – 10,000 deaths from flu each year so this tells us much about what we might accept with regard to Covid, although the impact on the most deprived parts of society and on certain ethnic minorities may reduce tolerance for such levels.” It is not yet clear where the UK public sits on this continuum and some push back at the notion that there is an acceptance of the current situation. “The idea that everyone is accepting the new normal is very dangerous,” said Prof Stephen Reicher, a psychologist at the University of St Andrews. “Then you reinforce a sense of fatalism.” Reicher points to a wealth of evidence in psychology showing that our behaviour can be shaped to a greater extent by what we think others think than by our own beliefs. “If your attitude is at odds with a perceived social norm, you’re less likely to act on it,” he said. According to Reicher, the government has been “systematically normalising” the UK’s current rate of infections. “They’ve been acting like this is inevitable, seeming relaxed about infections going up,” he said. “People often want a generic psychological explanation, but we mustn’t ignore the political and ideological context in which this is happening. We’re looking at a phenomenon of normalisation.” A powerful way of normalising a situation is to explain it through natural phenomenon, for instance putting the ongoing spread of Covid down to the virulent properties of the Delta variant. The media also plays a role in setting a perception of what is “normal”, according to Reicher. “[Research shows] that the media changes virtually nobody’s mind,” he said. “But it changes people’s belief about what others think.” The most recent surveys show that the public retain cautious attitudes on Covid safety. However, there is a widening gap between attitudes and behaviours. To some, the lack of public reaction to the ongoing death rate is bewildering. “It feels very surreal that we are just accepting the current infection rates. No one is making a fuss about it, but well over 100 people are dying every day due to Covid,” said Kit Yates, a senior lecturer in mathematics at the University of Bath. Yates points out that, while vaccination has changed the outcome of high Covid rates, having so much virus in circulation is not without consequence. “The current death rate is equivalent to over 40,000 people a year dying of Covid. This is not normal,” he said. “The government has abandoned all pretence at public health measures to control Covid. It’s a national scandal, but one which seems to have largely slipped from view.”\n",
      "The Oscar-winning film producer and environmentalist David Puttnam has announced his resignation from the House of Lords over concerns the UK government is on a “path to self-inflicted disaster”. Lord Puttnam, a Labour party member, was nominated to the Lords by Tony Blair in 1997 and has served on a number of select committees focusing on broadcast regulation, media plurality and digital communications. In his retirement speech on Friday, Puttnam warned of “multiple dangers” facing British democracy and accused Boris Johnson of running a “populist government that’s trampling on held rights and conventions, with the sole purpose of tightening its grip on power”. Puttnam pointed to the government’s plans to widen the Official Secrets Act, along with its proposed elections bill aimed at making photo ID mandatory at polling stations, as recent examples of creeping authoritarianism. His main concern though centred on the government’s lacklustre response to a report he co-authored as chair of the select committee on democracy and digital technologies in June 2020. In it, the committee warned political power was being “ceded to a few unelected and unaccountable digital corporations” and that a “pandemic of ‘misinformation’ and ‘disinformation’” had taken hold. “If allowed to flourish, these counterfeit truths will result in the collapse of public trust, and without trust democracy as we know it will simply decline into irrelevance,” the report said. The committee offered 45 recommendations for the government to implement that would update electoral law for the online age and create a more digitally literate society. “The ‘resurrection’ of our capacity to trust each other, and the systems through which we receive information – the same information on which we base many of the most important decisions of our lives – is fundamental to our survival …The only accurate way to describe the government’s response to our report is ‘lamentable’,” Puttnam said. A resident of West Cork in Ireland for more than 20 years, Puttnam also pointed to the “pig-ignorance” displayed by MPs during Brexit negotiations towards the Irish border as another reason for his departure from politics, and said he was “embarrassed” by the country Britain had become since leaving the EU. “Mirroring the anxieties of many of those angry Brexiteers in 2016, I feel I’ve had my country of birth, and the values I believed it to represent, stolen from me … I find myself embarrassed by what, on an almost daily basis, I see it becoming – my old enemy Rupert Murdoch’s dream made real. He never liked Britain, and he’s kind of won, he’s helped remake it in his own malevolent image,” he said.\n"
